Mhm .
-- and it 's gonna take a lot of time to indoctrinate them that they do realise what we 're trying to do there , and how we 're trying to help them .
Mm .
But then again , I do n't know how compatible the , the form of Islam they practice , I mean , a lot of the people there practices , with democracy , you know , when , when you have rules about , um , a woman 's place in society and , and how she has to have her head covered , and , and the place of religion in society , I mean , it 's , it 's a different ball game .
Right .
Entirely different than anything we 're accustomed to .
Right .
So , you know , I do n't -- I do n't know what 's gonna -- what 's gonna happen over there .
Ah , it 's complicated , it , it 'll -- it 'll stay that way for a long time I guess , I do n't , I do n't see , see an end , but I , I do know that , ah , if any , any progress is gonna be made , ah , some regimes have to change over here and , and over in Israel , you know .
Right .
Yeah , and this -- so this does n't leave an opening for , ah , bin Laden to come in here and do all kind of terroristic acts maybe that he 's been just waiting just for the right day and the right situation to pull off that we will be having our guard completely left down again because of all our soldiers , many of our soldiers --
Mm .
-- are in the far east right now , and --
And the thing --
-- not here to help .
-- about that is , is not , not that -- not like we should be listening to bin Laden or anything , but I mean , his whole point was that , ah , you know , Americans are taking over the world , they 're taking over the Middle East , they 're -- you know , they have their nose in , in a bunch of other stuff , and so what do we go do in response , we stick our nose in more stuff .
Right .
Yeah , that 's -- that 's gonna be -- lead to some far fetching troubles , is my thinking right now of it .
Right .
It 'll be something that they 'll wanna come back on us , and on to everything that we 're trying to do .
Right .
I guess part , part of my frustration , I think , is that , ah , yeah , the country is asleep to some degree , you know , they 're letting Bush say what he wants to say , do what he wants to do , and , ah , you know , there , there 's no end in sight .
I mean , he still has a very high approval rating , and , ah , you know , it seems like the Democrats are just folding their tents and they 're gonna kinda let two thousand and four go by , you know , hope -- I mean , I do n't hope there 's gonna be another , another terrorist attack , but I mean , if it does , I hope the timing of it is right , it opens up enough people 's eyes to , ah , make them think that we need a new direction in this country .
