You 're in THE SITUATION ROOM.
Senator Hillary Clinton is looking even more like a presidential today , after a weekend warm-up in the leadoff caucus state of Iowa .
There were telling some political moments during her swing through the Hawkeye State .
Let 's turn to our Candy Crowley .
She went to Iowa for the weekend to cover the senator -- Candy .
Wolf , this is what I know from spending this weekend in Iowa with Senator Clinton .
She has celebrity status .
It serves her well , drawing in the crowds and pumping up the volume .
It was a weekend Hillary-fest in Iowa .
Whoa .
Thank you !
Election-eve-sized coverage and standing-room-only crowds -- but it 's clear the senator from New York travels with baggage : her vote in favor of the first Iraq resolution .
She hopes to draw the sting with ever harsher assessments of the White House .
How , she was asked , having voted for the war , does she propose to end it .
The president has said this is going to be left to his successor .
And I think it 's the height of irresponsibility .
And I really resent it .
This was his decision to go to war .
He went with an ill-conceived plan and an incompetently executed strategy .
And we should expect him to extricate our country from this before he leaves office .
From the theaters , to the banners , to the lighting , this is a campaign in full swing , where celebrity status brings in the crowds , and little is left to chance , all of which makes one odd moment all the odder .
