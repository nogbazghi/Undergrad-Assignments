I ordered these because my Hoover calls for type " S" bags and they are quite hard to find in regular stores .
It turns out that even though these are type " S" bags and they are made by Hoover , they do n't seem to fit my vacuum , and now my vacuum sucks and then spits .
I think maybe I ordered the wrong thing .
