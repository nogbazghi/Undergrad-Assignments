What a great book !
Very informative and enjoyable for kids as well as for adults .
Our children loved the different exercises , the interesting facts and the photos throughout the book .
It made our vacation a lot more interesting and educational , which is exactly what we wanted .
The kids are taking the book to school to show their classmates and teachers .
We highly recommend this great book !<p> Hope to see one on U.S. National Parks soon !<p> Ed & Colleen Garcia
