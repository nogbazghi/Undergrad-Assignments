When my old Sears vac died , I decided to try the Shop-Vac 610 - it looked strong and the stainless steel tank looked like it would last forever .
One thing I neglected to check on was POWER .
This machine is light duty , and I should have known the small hose size was indicative of its capability - it is not nearly as powerful as the old , noisy Sears unit .
If anyone will make me an offer for this unit , I would like to upgrade to something that really performs like a shop vac should .
