OK I have to start by saying that this is n't nearly as great a vacuum as a Rainbow that I got back in '99 or 2000 and then lost when a relationship dissolved .
But then again , the Dyson is n't anywhere NEAR as expensive either .
This vacuum is great , it picks up just about everything , including sucking the hairs out of a cheap carpet we have in the dining room ...which is kind of funny to watch .
It 's easy to empty the bin and using attachments and extensions is intuitive and ergonomic .
I have only a couple complaints : one is that it 's not useful on bare floors .
It does have a bare floor setting but there is so much air moving that it blows dust and particles away from the nozzle so they do n't get sucked up until they are pinned against the wall .
Second is that it does n't fit under a standard counter unless you use an extension .
It 's a minor issue .
I bought this as a refurb through Amazon and if I somehow lost this vacuum I 'd buy another rebuild again .
It came with everything - all the attachments , documents , instructions , etc .
It had minor scratching on the canister but that 's it .
You can buy this vacuum with confidence .
