We 're also going to hear a lot today about consumer confidence .
In January , the measure of consumer confidence came in at the highest level in five years .
People are expecting it to come in a little lower than that for February , but still pretty strong .
And that 's what markets are going to be looking for is the consumer continuing to trek ahead , even if housing prices are coming down a little bit .
So it 's not so much how the retailers did fourth quarter , it 's how consumers feel right now that they 're most interested in .
Correct .
If retailers do well , it probably means the consumer 's strong .
But consumers have to actually be strong on their own .
And that 's what we 're going to spend this week talking about .
The stock markets were all down again for the fourth session .
So we 're going to be looking at how the markets react .
Oil was up again as well , and that always worries people about inflation .
But lots to keep track of today .
I 'll be back in a half an hour .
All right , Ali , get back to it .
Thank you very much .

It happened just a few hours ago .
Now , the vice president , Dick Cheney , was inside the base .
He was not hurt , but reports this morning say at least three people were killed , including two Americans .
Vice President Cheney left about an hour after the attack to meet with the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , in Kabul .

More details are emerging this morning about the vice president 's four-hour meeting with Pakistan 's president .
