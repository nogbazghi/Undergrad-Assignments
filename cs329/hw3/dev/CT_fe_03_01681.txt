-- because , I mean -- 'cause , you know , North Korea made all those threats .
Yeah .
Yeah .
Yeah .
So , I mean you think that 's going to be -- you think that 's going to be next ?
I mean what do you think they are going to do next , though ?
What do you think the US is going to do next ?
Oh .
My question is if someone says [inaudible ] " Okay , this is , uh , country to country " , so there is -- North Korea made a threat on the people --
Ahah .
-- US or other country .
Ahah .
And [inaudible ] my question is if someone says , " I am going to kill you " , does it equal to the mother or threatening is equal to mother , or , you know ?
Yeah .
Yeah , I understand .
Like , if they say that they 're going to do it , is that equal to them doing it .
Ahah .
And I do n't think it is .
I mean , I think it is necessary to protect yourself , but I think you can go over the limit and --
Ahah .
-- and I mean if you go just attack them like this because they make a threat --
Mhm .
-- it 's almost , I do n't know , it 's kind of borderline 'cause , I mean , it 's necessary to protect yourself , but on the other hand they claim that , you know , the US was being threatened and all this , but they never found any weapons .
Oh , yeah .
Yeah .
So it 's , like , you know , their claim that they 're under threat --
Yeah .
-- is -- is really questionable now .
Ahah .
So --
Yeah .
-- that 's -- I mean , that 's what I think it looks like .
Yeah .
And [inaudible ] --
What do you think will happen with , um , --
Ugh .
-- with -- what do you think with happen with Saddam Hussein ?
Do you think he 's still alive ?
What ?
Could you say it again ?
Er , do you think that Saddam is still alive ?
Oh , Saddam Hussein ?
Yeah .
Uh , it is very weird because , uh , US -- they said , the US government said that Saddam Hussein --
-- went to the Syria and Syria government said , uh , if the Saddam Hussein came , then they would expi- -- exterm[ ? ] him or something , you know .
Right .
Right .
Exter- -- uh , get him out of the country .
Right .
Yeah , so , oh , uh , I do n't know --
I mean do you think -- what do you --
-- [inaudible ] where he can go , you know .
Ahah .
Well , where do you think he is ?
He -- where he -- he is ?
Oh , one hand in the , uh , in Middle East there are lots big desert --
Ahah .
-- so , oh , he can go everywhere and that [inaudible ] even he -- he does not show his face --
