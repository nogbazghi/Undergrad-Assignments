As I have said elsewhere , I think Steve Chandler is among the wittiest and most intelligent guys around .
His writing is a lovely combination of autobiography , insight , humor and analysis .
His " self-help " books are among the finest I 've read .
I 'm guessing I 've read a few more novels than the folks who poured out the 5 star reviews .
Because this is a very bad novel , revealing the flaws of those who think that fiction writing is easy and who have access to a publisher .
Any editor would have prevented this dog from being published as is .
Here 's one sentence emblematic of the many things wrong with this book :
Jonathan looked around for a while before seating himself at a quiet table by the window and waited until a large , overweight gentleman who looked to be anywhere between 50 and 70 came to the table with a menu and a pitcher of water .
If you like that , you might enjoy this book .
If you find it a bit of a run-on , with sloppy redundancies , irrelevant detail , an endless parade of prepositional phrases ( a guaranteed murderer of snappy prose ) and poorly chosen modifiers , as I did , then you will stop now .
As another reviewer suggests , read their non-fiction .
It works .
This does n't .
Well , at least it was brief .
