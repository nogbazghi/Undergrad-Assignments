Sure , but one simply ca n't ignore the astonishing success of " Dreamgirls " .
And I 'm not just saying that because it had a black cast .
I mean , it 's an astonishing performance for any film with any color cast .
Is this going to open up more doors , do you think , for black casts , or is this a one-hit wonder ?
Well , possibly , it could .
You know , " Dreamgirls " leads all nominees with eight nominations , although it did not receive a best picture nod .
But you have to remember , this is a story about Motown .
This is a story loosely based on the Supremes .
So it 's a story about black people .
There you have the black actors .
Now , the real change is going to occur when you have roles that are not designated for a black person or a white person in particular , and those roles start to go more to black actors .
That UCLA study also stated that of the 46.5 percent of roles that do not designate race or ethnicity , those are understood to go to white people .
Think about a romantic comedy , for instance .
A lot of times we see maybe a Matthew McConaughey , a Kate Hudson , or a Cameron Diaz and a Jude Law .
Well , coming up there 's a romantic comedy called " I Think I Love My Wife . "
It stars Chris Rock and Kerry Washington .
But listen to this , Paula .
Chris Rock also directed and wrote that movie .
So you 've got to be a big name .
You 've got to be a powerhouse .
You 've got to have the funds .
And you 've got to be well respected and established .
So as I said , a lot of work to be done , but some people are indeed optimistic by what we see at the Oscars .
Thanks , Brooke .
Have a really good time this weekend .
I 'm kind of jealous .
Thank you .
When I worked in L.A. , that was one of my favorite assignments .
I was one of those pathetic ones that started ... ANDERSO
Come on out this weekend , Paula .
... camping out on Friday night to chart the path of all those folks that are -- had their pop tents out there and their sleeping bags .
Have fun .
It 's too cold for that tonight .
Thank you , though .
Yes .
Well , that still does n't discourage them from going out there .
Now back to tonight 's " Out in the Open " panel -- Amy Holmes , Joe Madison , Steve Malzberg .
Are we making too big a deal of race here ?
You know , I think we 're making too big a deal of Hollywood .
We 're talking about La La Land .
To have a successful career in Hollywood is to win the lottery .
And I do n't think any serious civil rights activist would advocate buying lottery tickets for progress .
If Jesse Jackson is serious about blacks being behind the camera , he should be talking about education , education , education .
Most movie directors go to film school .
That requires going to college and it requires further study .
Most movie executives have -- have business degrees .
There are a lot of Harvard MBAs and Stanford MBAs out there .
So...
