Jordan .
I 've heard --
And it 's really -- I 'm really afraid that this is going to lead to World War Three .
Well , um , it -- it 's just -- yet terrorism has existed , um , as a way of getting a message across since civilization began .
We cannot really --
Wipe it out .
Yeah .
Um --
We ca n't wipe it out but yet the things we 're doing could fall under the category of terrorism too .
Yes .
Because we did not have the approval of the governing body of the world .
The --
The UN.
-- the diplomacy -- right , center of the world , the UN , yet we did it .
And as far as I can see our only reasons were economic , in terms of being able to control oil in the future , and political , maintaining a hold on that part of the world so we can continue to have as much oil as we want at the cheapest --
Well --
-- rates possible .
And that does n't justify death --
No, it does n't .
-- of a nation , of it 's people .
And it 's culture .
And we 're doing -- and there 's all those children burnt and mutilated and maimed , without antibiotics , without water , without , you know , any kind of medicine .

Well , yes .
I understand that .
Um , we 're --
It 's --
It 's reprehensible .

Ah , I -- I really ca n't think of anything to , ah , to try and curtail it .
Um --
And what about the fact that they 're trying to pass the Patriot Act Two , when the +Patriot Act One is already unconstitutional ?
A- and it -- and as far as I heard , um , there has been , ah , like , twenty or thirty states that are actually trying to challenge it .
That 's wonderful .
It jus -
Oh , that is wonderful .
It 's Mc- -- it 's McCarthyesque .
You , ah --
It 's worse than McCarthyesque .
Anybody , uh -- if they dissent against the -- against Bush and his group of people can be thrown in prison , held indefinitely .
Well that means you and I since --
Yes .
-- we 're speaking on a recorded tape from the University of Pennsylvania .
It 's just anybody can be -- c - can be held and labeled as a terrorist .
Any -- public records are -- can be seized .
But there 's a difference between having a view and doing something to put it into action .
I think people are entitled to hold whatever view they want but it 's highly different --
