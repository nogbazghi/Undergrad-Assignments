As John Broughton hosed the mud from his
driveway Friday , his wife Grace said the recent flooding had n't
dampened the couple 's enthusiasm for living on an island in
the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta .
" It 's like going back in time to the '50s or '60s , "
Grace Broughton , 66 , said .
" It 's quiet , peaceful .
You do n't have
to put your dogs on a leash .
Everyone looks out
for each other . "
The Broughtons and their neighbors live at Snug Harbor , a small
community along Steamboat Slough near Rio Vista that consists of
private homes and an RV vacation park with fishing cabins .
For the past two weeks -- because of the rains , dam
releases and high tides -- the Ryer Island community has
been partially submerged under the rising waters of the slough .
Yet those who live in places such as Snug Harbor , on
low-lying islands in the Delta , have opted for the simple
pleasures of boating , fishing and country life despite the dangers
and headaches of winter flooding .
Some are retired , but many make the long trek to Sacramento
or the Bay Area for work .
As the waters have risen , John Broughton , 68 , has continued to
drive to Concord , where he works as a contractor .
With
the ferries to Ryer Island down because of the swift-flowing
waters , he has had to drive far out of his
way across the island 's only bridge .
The Broughtons moved to Snug Harbor 14 years ago from a
Fairfield subdivision .
During the floods of 1997 , they said , they
had 18 inches of water in their island house .
" It felt like 18 feet , " said Grace Broughton .
They raised the house 8 feet , leaving a 2-foot clearance under
the bottom floor for water to flow from Steamboat Slough
to a smaller channel behind their property .
During the recent deluge , which was minor by 1997 standards , the
Broughtons and their neighbors have helped each other with trips
to the grocery store and the Walnut Grove post office
and with various problems associated with flooded yards and garages .
" You do n't find that kind of living in the city , " said
John Broughton .
Vicki Vann , 52 , and her husband Gene Henderson , 41 , work at
Snug Harbor Resort , with Vann as the manager and Henderson
as the handyman .
They moved from Sacramento eight years ago after vacationing on the
island for two years .
Making mortgage payments on their Sacramento home and holding down more
traditional jobs -- Vann in the corporate world and Henderson
in the construction business -- just were n't fulfilling anymore , they
said .
Instead , the couple wanted to live where they vacationed .
" We were working to support our house and ran away here
whenever we could , " Vann said .
Offered jobs at the resort by the Napa couple who own
the RV park and rental cabins , Vann and Henderson decided
to sell their house and move to the island .
Both
seem delighted with their decision .
" It 's like another planet , " Vann said .
" The people are so friendly .
It 's a slower pace of life . "

Doctors , lawyers , firefighters and police officers all call Snug Harbor Drive
home , she said .
" People will jump a lot faster to help you , " Henderson said .
" If you need a hand , the people up the road
are on it . "
Henderson himself is regarded by his neighbors as one of the
most helpful people in the Delta .
During the floods he
secured propane tanks so they would n't float away and has
been struggling to clear the roadway of water .
On Friday , he drove to the home of a neighbor and
carried her young daughter over his shoulder through the floodwaters
so she could visit his house to watch TV .
Though he seems to love his work , Henderson 's eyes light up
even more when the talk turns to fishing .
Many people ask his advice on where to catch the big
ones , but Henderson said his favorite fishing spot is the
slough right near his house .
" I figure I live right here , " he said .
" I can just
cast out ."
Ken Fischer , 62 , said he too had an RV at Snug
Harbor .
He moved from Lincoln last year to be able
to boat and fish as much as possible .
" I always wanted to be on the water and fish , " he
said .
" I just go for long boat rides .
" It 's peaceful here , " he said .
" There are otters playing in the
backyard and lots of bird life . "
An insurance auditor , Fischer said he spends many hours on the
road and is always pleased to come home .
" I get off the freeways with the crazy drivers , " he said .
" Once I get on the levee road , I still have
30 miles to go , and it 's very peaceful . "
Fischer said his wife works in downtown Sacramento and does n't complain
abut the commute .
She also loves to go fishing and
boating , he said .
His elevated house is dry inside , but the recent flooding has
caused him some anxiety , he admitted .
On Friday , water poured in a brisk stream through his garage ,
and his yard was entirely flooded .
Still , Fischer said it 's
the first time he 's seen such flooding .
" They say it has n't been this high since 1997 , " he said .
Dick Gordon , a retired California Highway Patrol officer , moved to the
Delta years ago so his family could enjoy boating and
water sports .
The home he originally bought had a slab foundation and was
low to the ground .
After floods struck , he tore it
down and built a bigger house with a raised foundation .
" I got tired of watching my sofa float out the
back door , " he said .
Now with the raised house , he 's largely out of harm 's way ,
though his yard is flooded .
Gordon said he has no intention of moving .
" If you like water , there 's 1,100 miles of waterways , " he said .
" There 's no ruckus , no hassles .
" We have these events , " he said , nodding to the floodwaters .
" But
I 've learned to deal with the events , and then it 's
just another day . "
