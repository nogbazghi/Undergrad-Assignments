Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito told senators Monday that
a judge 's obligation is solely to the rule of law ,
but the lawmakers signaled that fresh policy controversies and partisan
views will be elements of his confirmation hearings .
" In every single case , the judge has to do what the
law requires , " Alito said in an 11-minute statement on the
opening day of the hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
The 55-year-old conservative federal appeals judge , who is President Bush 's choice
to succeed retiring centrist Justice Sandra Day O'Connor , said good
judges develop habits such as delaying their conclusions until everything
has been considered .
" Good judges are always open to the possibility of changing their
minds , " he said .
He drew a distinction between his job as a judge and
his days as a government lawyer in the Reagan administration ,
when he offered opinions such as that the Constitution guarantees
no right to abortion .
" The role of a practicing attorney is to achieve a desirable
result for the client in the particular case at hand .
But a judge ca n't think that way , " Alito said .
" A
judge ca n't have any agenda , a judge ca n't have any
preferred outcome in any particular case and a judge certainly
does n't have a client . "
Alito , who served as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey and
has spent the past 15 years on the Philadelphia-based 3rd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , also said judges must treat
all parties equally .
" No person in this country , no matter how high or powerful ,
is above the law , " he said , " and no person in
this country is beneath the law . "
The committee of 10 Republicans and eight Democrats begins its first
round of questioning today .
Its vote is tentatively scheduled for
next week , with the Republican-dominated Senate deciding Alito 's fate later
this month .
Senators ' opening statements Monday largely broke along party lines , with Democrats
challenging Alito to defend his positions on the key issues
of abortion rights , presidential powers , voting rights and privacy .
Republicans urged Alito to refrain from discussing any issue likely to
come before the high court .
Abortion is expected to take center stage in the hearings because
of Alito 's professional writings .
As an attorney in the Justice Department , Alito counseled the Reagan
administration to chip away at abortion rights until 1973 landmark
Roe v. Wade decision could be overturned .
The right to
privacy established in Griswold v. Connecticut in 1965 laid the
foundation for Roe v. Wade , which legalized abortion nationwide .
Alito also is expected to be grilled extensively by Republicans and
Democrats on his views on executive branch powers and the
court 's role in checking them .
The Bush administration is being criticized for authorizing spying on American
citizens without getting court warrants .
The administration also has used
the threat of terrorism in the post-Sept .
11 era as
justification for holding hundreds of detainees , without charges , at a
Navy prison camp in Cuba and for advocating the right
to torture terror suspects .
Alito has expressed support for a strong executive branch and has
written about the " supremacy " of the executive and legislative branches
over the judicial branch .
" In an era when the White House is abusing power , is
excusing and authorizing torture , and is spying on American citizens ,
I find Judge Alito 's support for an all-powerful executive branch
to be genuinely troubling , " Sen. Edward Kennedy , D-Mass. , said at
the hearings .
" Ultimately , the courts will make the final judgment
whether the White House has gone too far . "
Sen.
Russ Feingold , D-Wis. , said the country needs judges who will
" stand up and tell the executive branch it is wrong
when it ignores or distorts the laws passed by Congress "
and defend constitutional rights and freedoms "even when the president
of the United States is telling the country that he
should be able to decide unilaterally how far those freedoms
go . "
Republicans said Alito could bring clarity and common sense to the
high court .
" I do n't expect to agree with every case you decide , " said
Sen.
Mike DeWine , R-Ohio , " but your modest approach to judging
seems to bode well for our democracy . "
Sen.
John Cornyn , R-Texas , complained that liberal groups opposing Alito 's nomination
are doing so because the judge wo n't support their political
agenda .
" And the reason they oppose you is precisely why I support
you , " he said .
" I want judges on the Supreme Court
who will not use their position to impose a political
agenda on the American people . "
After eating breakfast with Bush at the White House , Alito and
his wife , Martha , son Philip and daughter Laura , as well
as his sister and several other relatives , listened to the
senators ' remarks before Alito took center stage .
In contrast to the easy manner and polished delivery of Chief
Justice John Roberts during his confirmation hearings last fall , nervousness
showed in the bookish Alito 's presentation .
But he took his time composing himself , then took a slow
drink of water before beginning his brief remarks with a
joke about a lawyer arguing his first case before the
Supreme Court .
When one of the justices asked the lawyer , " How did you
get here ? "
-- meaning how had his case made it
to the high court -- Alito said the nervous lawyer
replied , " I came here on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad . "
" This story has come to my mind in recent weeks because
I have often asked myself , How in the world did
I get here ? "
Alito said .
The judge cited the influences of his teacher mother and Italian
immigrant father .
He said committee members and staffers have his sympathy because they
had to review hundreds of his court opinions , which he
said "may have constituted cruel and unusual punishment . "
Bush nominated Alito after an earlier choice for the O'Connor seat ,
White House counsel Harriet Miers , withdrew in the face of
criticism about her lack of judicial experience and pressure from
conservative groups hoping for a nominee with a clear conservative
record .
