Mm-hmm .
And you talk about looking into the future , 10 years , five years .
I want to talk predictions .
One year from now , will we still be saying , ` Britney is messed up` ?
Or , ` Britney has made a big comeback ; she` s back on track` ?
What do you think , Jill ?
I think it`ll take a little longer than a year .
Originally , when we started 2007 , I thought this could be the year for her , because we expect an album to come out this year .
But it looks like she` s got a long road .
She` s moving very slowly in terms of progress , and even staying in rehab .
So I do n` t think one year she` s going to be back , but I hope that she will be back .
Maybe in five years .
Hopefully so .
Hopefully it wo n` t take too long for her .
We wish her the best .
" Star " magazine` s Jill Dawson ( ph ) ( sic ) , " Radar " magazine` s Tyler Gray , thank you both for your insight .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Well , yesterday we asked you to vote on our SHOWBIZ TONIGHT " Question of the Day . "
A lot of people writing in on this : " Britney Spears Vs .
K-Fed : Should Kevin Federline get custody of their children ?
Very interesting ; I do n` t think this would have been the result a couple of months ago .
Sixty-one percent of you say , ` Yes , the kids to K- Fed .`
Thirty-nine percent of you said , ` No .`
As I said , a lot of e-mails came in , including one from Yulia in Canada , who writes , " I` m sure it` s a temporary weakness for Britney .
In the meantime , her mom will be the best guardian for the kids . "
We also hear from Joanne from West Virginia .
Joanne writes , " Until Britney gets herself straightened out , Kevin should get temporary sole custody of the children . "
Well , SHOWBIZ TONIGHT has uncovered a shocking and eerie video of a pregnant Anna Nicole Smith reaching out to Britney Spears and asking her to be friends .
It` s from Anna Nicole` s Web site , annanicole .com .
She was making these videos and charging people for a look into her private life .
Watch this .
I just wanted to say to Britney Spears , if you see this for some ( INAUDIBLE ) reason , because ( INAUDIBLE) , and you want to be friends , I would so much love to hang out with you .
I think you`re totally cool , and I think we`re about to have our babies around the same time .
And I do n` t know .
I`d just love to meet you .
( INAUDIBLE) .
So if you want to get in touch , you can call my lawyer , my best friend , my confidant , Howard Stern .
I think everyone has his number .
( INAUDIBLE ) to you , Britney .
Big kiss , and I hope that you do great on your second pregnancy .
. Thank you ( INAUDIBLE )
Hmm .
A little bit odd , right ?
Well , now there` s another really important thing in there .
Did you hear when Anna mentioned Howard K. Stern ?
She did n` t say anything about him being the father of her soon-to-be-born baby at the time , or that he was even her lover .
Just best friend .
