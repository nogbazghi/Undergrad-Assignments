Hi , Nancy , you`re the best .
Thank you , dear .
What` s your question ?
My question is , Richard Millstein , as you were just discussing , the court-appointed guardian ad litem , is supposed to be advocating for Dannielynn` s best interests .
Therefore , why is it that he is not demanding DNA testing ?
Why is he not advocating on behalf of or in conjunction with everyone ?
Well , Cheryl , I think wisely Millstein knows that the jurisdiction over the DNA testing is where the baby is , and that baby is in the Bahamas .
All these motions regarding paternity should have rightly been filed down there at the get-go , instead of all this incessant whining in front of the microphone and the camera .
Out to you , Sherri in Texas , hi , Sherri .
Hi .
What` s your question , dear ?
Well , I` m curious as to whether Mr. Stern can claim to be her common-law husband , and , therefore , her next of kin ?
Oh , interesting .
Let` s go out to Godfrey " Pro " Pinder .
He is the attorney for G. Ben Thompson .
Mr.
Pinder , thank you for being with us .
GODFREY PINDER , ATTORNEY FOR ANNA` S LANDLOR
Thank you .
What about the possibility of him being established as a common-law husband ?
I think I`ve got Mr. Pinder on the phone .
Hi , can you hear me ?
Yes , I` m on the line .
You`re talking about a common-law husband ?
Yes , is it possible that Stern could be considered a common - law husband ?
No.
He has to be at least seven years with a woman , living in the Bahamas in the house before he can be established as a common-law husband .
Well , Mr. Pinder has the answer on the law .
Everything else is in flux tonight .
At least we`ve got one straight answer .
Back out to you , Mike Brooks , former D.C. cop and former fed with the FBI .
Why are U.S. law enforcement down in the Bahamas ?
That` s a good question , Nancy .
Sources close to the investigation that I spoke to today said that two investigators from Florida were here speaking with a doctor .
Apparently this doctor , Hubert Menace ( ph ) , is the OB-GYN of Anna Nicole Smith .
Now , what they want to know , and the questions they were going to ask this doctor is , what kind of drugs did he prescribe to her before , during and after her pregnancy ?
And what this says to me , Nancy , as a former investigator , is , I think some things are starting to come back from the toxicology tests , and they`re now looking to draw a parallel , maybe a link analysis between the death of Daniel and the death of Anna Nicole in Florida .
But I tell you what , I` m anxious to hear exactly what they have to say and what they found out from this doctor and if they are able to draw a link between the two , because , keep in mind , we still have a coroner` s inquest on March 26th here in the Bahamas into the cause of death of Daniel .
We still do n` t know .
That has not been answered as of yet .
And there` s supposed to be 30 witnesses appear at this coroner` s inquest .
And I can tell you , the chief magistrate here is licking his chops to get Howard Stern on the stand and question him , because he` s the only living person who was in that hospital room when Daniel died .
