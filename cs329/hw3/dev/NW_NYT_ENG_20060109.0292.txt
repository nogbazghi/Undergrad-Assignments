Rising loan costs may alter the way first-time
and moderate-income home buyers get their dream homes .
For the past three years , many consumers have turned to second
mortgages to secure increasingly expensive homes with lower down payments .
These second mortgages , or piggyback loans , allow buyers to avoid
the higher cost of mortgage insurance .
Piggybacks have been a bargain the past few years because of
historically low interest rates .
But interest rates have risen as
the Federal Reserve bumped up short-term rates 13 times since
June 2004 .
Now piggybacks are becoming more expensive , and mortgage insurance is getting
a second look .
Lenders require home buyers who ca n't put 20 percent down on
their home to buy mortgage insurance .
The money compensates the
lender if the homeowner defaults , but it adds $ 10 to
$ 200 to the monthly mortgage payment .
The piggybacks , which generally
carry adjustable rates , typically cover half of the 20 percent
down payment .
Carter Pettibone was considering a piggyback loan recently .
The 33-year-old city
employee had about 5 percent to put down on a
home near downtown Raleigh .
After going over some price calculations with his mortgage lender , Pettibone
realized that a mortgage insurance policy would actually be cheaper
than a piggyback .
That decision would have been unlikely a year ago .
The monthly cost of piggybacks still tends to undercut mortgage insurance
policies , but the spread between the two is narrowing significantly ,
said Ken Williams , president of Dover Mortgage in Clayton .
For borrowers with 10 percent or more to put down , Williams
said , the two products are almost evenly priced .
The housing boom of the past three years pumped demand for
piggybacks as home buyers looked for ways to get into
pricier homes .
The Federal Reserve has warned that high levels
of mortgage debt from piggybacks could trigger a wave of
foreclosures down the road .
" Home values went through the roof , and people had to borrow
a greater percentage of the value of their homes , " said
Stuart Feldstein , president of SMR Research Corp. , a Hackettstown , NJ-based
firm that tracks the mortgage industry .
Piggybacks enabled that market by circumventing mortgage insurance and helping borrowers
keep monthly payments down .
Unless interest rates climb significantly , piggyback loans will remain an attractive
alterative for home buyers , said Edwin Groshans , an analyst with
Fox-Pitt , Kelton , a brokerage that specializes in financial institutions .
Groshans estimates that the Federal Funds rate , which helps determine the
price of adjustable-rate loans such as piggybacks , would have to
rise an additional 1.75 percentage points before mortgage insurance policies
are cheaper on average than piggybacks .
The Federal Reserve is
expected to raise rates by about half a percentage point
this year .
While piggyback borrowers who use a home-equity line of credit as
the second loan probably paid rates below 5 percent in
2004 , rising rates have put home-equity lines closer to 7
percent -- not nearly the same bargain .
ALTERNATIVES TO MORTGAGE INSURANCE
Low interest rates in recent years cheered consumers , but they hurt
at Genworth Mortgage Insurance , a Raleigh-based company that sells private
mortgage insurance to home buyers .
In the past three years , Genworth Mortgage lost more than 40
percent of its first-time home buyer business to lenders offering
piggyback and refinancing loans as cheaper alternatives to mortgage insurance .
" Our business was impacted , " said Kevin Schneider , president of Genworth Mortgage ,
a division of Richmond , Va.-based Genworth Financial .
As rates climb , the company is trying to win back the
home buyers and owners who fled to cheaper alternatives .
It
has teamed with the N.C .
Housing Finance Agency to subsidize
loans to first-time and moderate-income home buyers .
The campaign is
called SimplePlus .
In addition to standard default insurance , SimplePlus provides extras to the
home buyer , such as unemployment insurance , and reimbursements on appraisal
costs .
The reimbursement effectively provides borrowers a free exit when
their home equity rises enough that they can cancel their
policy .
" A product like Genworth 's that also protects consumers is a good
start , " said Stuart Feldstein , president of SMR Research Corp. , a
Hackettstown , NJ-based firm that tracks the mortgage industry .
" Especially given
the rising cost of loans . "
He said increasing consumer caution in 2006 will spur more borrowers
to opt for safe options , even if it means a
few dollars extra each month .
Genworth plans to roll out its program through state housing finance
agencies .
" Strategically , we 're entering a new interest rate environment where the cost
of alternative products is rising , " Schneider said .
" SimplePlus is designed
to help claw our way back in the market that
had been lost . "
