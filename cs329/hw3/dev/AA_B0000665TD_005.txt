I 've had an older Jiffy Steamer for about 20 years , and it 's always worked like a champ .
I 'm a professional photo stylist , so I use it a lot , and have taken it on many trips , so it 's been shipped just about everywhere .
Finally decided to get a newer model , which is much lighter , thus less expensive to ship .
I love it , works as great as the last one .
