William Parry is my Trombone guru !
I 'm a trombone player who has stuttered for 17 years .
However , I was a great trombonist in High School , winning awards and everything .
My stuttering on the horn started in my 2nd year of college as a music major and went on until just recently when I purchased William 's book .
Although the first few chapters are lengthy and take time to read and absorb , it 's important to read the entire book .
I 'm sure glad I did , because the last few chapters have a gold mine of information .
3 weeks after finishing the book , my stuttering is reduced drastically .
Not only that , but if I ever stutter again , ( and perhaps I will ) , I 'll know how to deal with it .
Get this book and make sure to read the entire book ( it 's a bit long , but very helpful ) .
Then do the exercises he prescribes ( and do them religiously ) and watch it work miracles on your stuttering !
This is the book ! ! !
Currently , I 'm now a trombonist in demand and my students are also improving .
I 'm performing very hard solos in very successful bands while getting paid .
The trick is to do the exercises no matter what , and everything will improve as time goes on .
