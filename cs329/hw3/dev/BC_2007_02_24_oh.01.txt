And we want to bring you an update now on some -- really dangerous weather that 's starting to take place .
We 've been talking about this kind of this morning , the potential for it .
But it appears now that we 're starting to see this stuff -- stuff pop up .
We 're going to check in with our Reynolds Wolf standing by in the severe weather center .
A wide area now under the gun kind of .
Right now , OPEN HOUSE is going to continue right after a quick break .
We 'll see you soon .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK)
OK .
We all do it , on the phone , in person , and writing .
It 's complaining .
But you may not always be complaing the right way to get what you want .
To help us perfect the art form of complaining is life coach , author , " O Magazine " contributor -- many accolades here -- Martha Beck from Phoenix , Arizona .
Martha , good to see you .
Great to be here .
Now , OK , I just have to complain about complaining for a second .
You know , when you 're dealing with a big company and they have a system , a customer service line , an 800 number for you to complain on , it 's more like a buffer .
It seems more like a way of keeping you from getting what you want rather than helping you .
How do you get through that ?
Well , you have to be persistent about looking for a real human , for one thing .
Now they often have systems of computerized levels of complaining .
You need to keep buzzing through until you actually get to a person .
Right .
And at that point you have to -- you have to make sure it 's the person who 's in enough control to be able to change the situation .
How do you know that ?
So many of these people are reading from scripts , you can tell .
Right .
You ask .
Really ?
So , I just say ...
It 's that simple .
It 's as simple as saying , what , " Can you fix this for me ? " Or...
No.
You say , " Exactly what is your level of expertise ?
Is there someone above you in the hierarchy who might be able to help me instead of just listening to the complaint ? "
And the person will be recorded usually for quality assurance .
And if you ask to see someone up the chain a little bit , they kind of have to bump you up the chain .
I love that .
OK .
You say state the problem clearly .
Once you do , get to the person in charge .
How do you do that ?
Well , there are four steps to complaining effectively , and the first one is to know specifically exactly what 's wrong .
If you do n't specify the problem , if you just say , " I 'm not satisfied , " you 're really not giving them any information that 's going to help them fix the situation .
All right .
So , you know , I think a lot of people mess up that step , frankly .
They do n't have anything specific .
They do n't have days and dates of when things went wrong .
You know , they kind of waffle when it gets to the real complaint .
