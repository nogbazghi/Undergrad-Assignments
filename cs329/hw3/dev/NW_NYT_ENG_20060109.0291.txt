The top executive at Medicare , accompanied by a
bus plastered with photographs of beaming senior citizens , came to
Fayetteville on Monday to urge older adults and disabled people
to enroll in the prescription drug program that took effect
Jan .
1 .
" Some people are finding out that the coverage is better and
costs less than they expected , " said Dr. Mark McClellan , administrator
of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , the federal
agency that runs Medicare .
But even some North Carolina seniors who have signed up for
the benefit , Medicare Part D , are n't so sure .
And many
pharmacists and consumer advocates have been frustrated by enrollment glitches ,
computer problems and other difficulties in the new benefit 's first
days .
In North Carolina , 38 Part D options are being offered by
16 private companies .
Medicare HMOs and other private Medicare plans
are offering 15 plans .
Christina Washington , a pharmacist who owns Medical Arts Pharmacy in downtown
Fayetteville , told McClellan the federal government did n't adequately prepare pharmacists .
" We have been in an awful position , " said Washington , whose pharmacy
was inundated last week as patients with Medicare drug coverage
came to fill prescriptions .
Particularly difficult to deal with , she
said , were patients who previously got medicines through Medicaid , but
had been automatically assigned to Medicare Part D. The phone
line that pharmacists were to call to resolve Medicare problems
and questions was n't available until Thursday -- four days after
the coverage took effect .
" Half of them did n't even have ( identification ) cards , " Washington said .
" Some
people came in with prescriptions for drugs that are not
covered by the plans that were pre-selected for them . "
Durham pharmacist Jennifer Burch said she was glad to hear that
someone spoke up for pharmacists at McClellan 's talk , which she
did not attend .
Burch , who owns Central Pharmacy on North
Duke Street with her father , pharmacist Bill Burch , agrees that
pharmacies are bearing the brunt of patients ' frustrations with the
new benefit .
" I had an oncology patient come in with a prescription for
a liquid medication and his plan did not cover it , "
Burch said .
" He said , ' But I have the Medicare drug
plan ' .
People do not understand the limitations of this coverage . "
The patient said he could not afford to pay $ 65 for
the medicine , so he asked for half the amount his
doctor had prescribed to save money , Burch said .
McClellan , one of a handful of federal officials who have been
touring the country since early fall to promote Medicare Part
D , acknowledged that there have been bumps in the first
days of the benefit .
But , he said , that is to
be expected with a new insurance program .
" Every time people sign up for new benefits it 's confusing and
there are going to be problems , " McClellan said in an
interview after his talk to an audience of about 50
people at Northwood Temple Academy .
" But we 're helping people work
through them and we 're going to keep helping them . "
McClellan said the nation 's pharmacists have been "terrific " in walking patients
through the new benefit .
He said he is pleased with the response to Medicare Part
D.
He said about 1 million prescriptions were processed through
the new drug program Friday .
UNSURE OF COSTS
Pat Nowiski , 70 , of Fayetteville , said she signed up for Medicare
Part D to help pay for her cholesterol and heart
medicines and drugs to manage her diabetes .
But she is n't
sure she 'll save much after she adds up the cost
of the premium , copayments , and the "donut hole " or coverage
gap in the new benefit .
Under a standard Medicare Part
D plan , patients would be required to pay 100 percent
of the cost of their medicines after their drug expenses
exceed $ 2,250 .
" I do n't know if it will be cheaper for me or
not , " said Nowiski , who estimates she spends about $ 450 a
month on medicines .
She has n't yet filled a prescription using
the new coverage .
Nowiski was n't the only person with questions about the gap in
coverage -- one of the most unpopular features of Medicare
Part D. McClellan told seniors that many health insurers , including
several offering coverage in North Carolina , have plans that do
not have a gap .
Instead , the plans require patients to
pay a set copayment that remains constant throughout the year ,
no matter what their drug costs are .
" They may be a little more expensive , but if you want
a plan that fills in the donut hole , you can
get that , " McClellan said .
GETTING ANSWERS
McClellan told people interested in the drug program , including family members
or caregivers helping a Medicare member , that there are plenty
of places to get help .
Medicare 's toll-free telephone line , ( 800 ) 633-4227 , offers answers , and members or
their helpers can compare prescription drug plans by coverage and
cost at www.medicare .gov.
In North Carolina , seniors may contact the
state Seniors ' Health Insurance Information Program or SHIIP , which had
several counselor at Monday 's event to answer questions and enroll
seniors in Medicare Part D.
Molly Bethea , 63 , came to McClellan 's appearance prepared .
She is n't eligible
for Medicare Part D for two years , but her husband
Jay , 65 , is eligible now .
Bethea brought a list of
her husband 's medicines , including dosages , and what the couple is
paying for them now .
A SHIIP counselor punched the information
into the Part D plan finder tool on Medicare 's Web
page and pulled up a list of plans that best
met Jay Bethea 's needs .
" It was very helpful , " said Bethea , who took home a list
of the three best choices .
" I 'm going to take it
home and let him look at it . "
