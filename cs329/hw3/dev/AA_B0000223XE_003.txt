I have had this shop vac less than 3 months and the front casters have broke .
One of them has been totaly destroyed .
It ( the ) shop vac has not been abused at all .
The other day I noticed that the shop vac was moving poorly on my drive way .
So I checked it out and found that one of the front casters was totaly broken .
How do I GET new casters for this shop vac.
model #LPV550/ 16gal , 5.5 hp .
I went back to Lowes and bought a new set of casters but they did not fit .
Please Help .
thanx
