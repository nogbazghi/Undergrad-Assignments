to earth as acid rain .
Nitrogen oxide leads to ozone .
Further reductions are expected after 2015 from EPA 's recently adopted Clean
Air Interstate Rule .
That federal rule permanently caps emissions of
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in 28 eastern states to
reduce pollution .
But the interstate rule does not specify which power plants must
install new controls -- and that is part of the
concern for North Carolina officials .
Utilities have some flexibility to make the cuts by adding pollution
controls or by purchasing pollution credits from utilities elsewhere that
have made deeper cuts than required .
Environmentalists say a successful lawsuit could ensure that power plants in
states near North Carolina install pollution controls .
" The Clean Air Interstate Rule is going to reduce average pollution
around the country , but nobody lives in average , " said Nat
Mund , a lobbyist for the Sierra Club in Washington .
" There
is no guarantee that the reductions will occur in places
that will help North Carolina . "
REMEDIES IN PROGRESS
But utilities , including TVA , have won several significant legal victories recently
in air pollution cases brought by the EPA.
Scott Segal , director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council , a coalition
of power companies , said , " I think the state of North
Carolina 's resources are better spent pursuing other mechanisms to encourage
clean air , such as mass transit and car pooling , rather
than at advancing questionable legal theories at great expense . "
TVA has 59 coal-fired units at 11 power plants in three
states , primarily in Tennessee ( a plant may have multiple units ) .
North Carolina has 45 coal-fired units at 14 plants owned
by Progress Energy and Duke Power .
Since the late 1970s , TVA has installed scrubbers on its six
largest units to cut sulfur dioxide to comply with federal
limits .
The utility has two more scrubbers under construction at
plants in Tennessee and Kentucky .
And it is engineering the
scrubbers for its large nine-unit Kingston plant near Knoxville , to
be operational around 2010 , said John Moulton , a TVA spokesman .
North Carolina is just getting started .
As part of the state 's
Clean Smokestacks Act , adopted in 2002 , utilities in North Carolina
are installing pollution controls to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides
and sulfur dioxide by no later than 2012 .
Progress Energy
inaugurated its first scrubber on a North Carolina plant late
last year .
Duke Power 's first scrubber is to start removing
pollution at its Marshall plant late this year .
By 2012 , Progress Energy and Duke Power collectively will have scrubbers
on 22 of their 45 coal units in the state .
TVA also has installed about twice as many pollution control units
to reduce nitrogen oxides as North Carolina utilities have .
Jeff Gleason , a lawyer with the Southern Environmental Law Center in
Charlottesville , Va. , said the amount of pollution reductions that TVA
has made reflects the high amounts of pollution the plants
emitted .
Even with six operational scrubbers , TVA plants emitted more sulfur dioxide
than North Carolina power plants in 2004 , according to EPA
data .
