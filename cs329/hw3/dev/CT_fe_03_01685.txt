Yeah , it was and now , um , it was -- it was kind of , um , -- I -- I did n't realize it , but I got thinking about it after I 'd seen it , you know , heard about this , but I went to school for psychology and I never gave it any thought but , you know , they said when them POWs are together , like , that for a long time they get so trusting of each other they do n't want to separate --
Yeah .
-- and , um , there was a problem when they were in the hospital , you know , they did n't want to be separated , they wanted to be with one another and it -- I would see it being hard to separate because you 're thinking you 're going to die and they 're the last people , you know , faces that you can trust with you and so I was , like , " Wow" , you know , I never gave that a thought that they would bond so strongly , you know --
Mhm .
-- so I bet that was hard for them to go home and leave them because they kept one another safe and kept one another going and then going home to your family would be tough .
Yeah , it would be tough .
It 'd be -- it 'd be a mental strain .
The --
Yeah , it really would .
-- just like the girl , Jessica , that got all that stuff done to her , can you imagine having to come back over here and trying to deal with all this ?
Oh , my goodness , no .
No.
And they 're just -- they 're just over bundling her with stuff , you know , people are writing , I 'm sure , and --
Yeah .
-- you know , and all kinds of stuff coming in the mail , you know .
She 's getting just a bunch of stuff and I mean she deserves it .
Yeah .
W- -- that 's where , um , you know , they 've been discussing this bit and I listen to Coast to Coast and they got it on there quite a little bit , the AM radio , you know , they 've been talking about having -- even that 's the problem , they say , about putting women on the front line , because the men get really protective of the women because they know the dangers of being in these kind of countries , like , you know , w- where we 're at right now .
It 's because they 're savages , you know , Saddam 's boys himself -- themselves were , you know , horrible guys .
I mean they kill and rape and everything and that 's the problem they 're getting into now , is actually putting these women in harm 's way like this because , um , so much more can happen to them psychologically --
Mhm .
-- I think , than guys , you know , is what they 're saying .
I do n't know .
I know I would n't be the same , ever the same .
Uh , I mean , er , you know , when you get your dignity taken from you like she did , I 'm sure , you know .
