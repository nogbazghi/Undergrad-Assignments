-- it 's not my place --
Right , that 's their way of life , right .
-- to go in and tell them .
Yeah , you 're -- you 're absolutely right .
You know , how do you go in and make someone else change , and yet those changes are , um , part of what keeps them , um , in a lot of turmoil because --
Yeah .
-- um , groups , different groups such as women , ah , um , th - that 's the one that o - obviously comes to -- comes to mind the most .
Yeah .
Um , they -- they see the way the rest of the world reacts and , um , not just reacts but gets to act , um , in their own countries and , um , it creates an unrest for them .
So I feel --
Yeah .
-- like , you know , there 's -- there 's just a lot of issues there that -- that I do n't know that they can overcome .
Yeah .
Or it 's definitely going to take a lot .
Yeah .
Well , and I also think that being in countries where the government is based on a religious group and everybody in the country 's not from that religious group --
Mhm .
-- that that 's definitely a basis for lots of the unrest .
Agreed .
And that , you know , if you 're going to -- going to base your government on your moral beliefs and things like that , then you 're definitely going to have people disagreeing with you .
Mhm .
So , yeah , I 've -- just in --
So that 'll cau - --
-- hearing --
It 'll cause unrest also , right .
Yeah , yeah , just hearing in the past few days how in Iraq they 're talking about wanting to set up a new Muslim government --
Yeah .
-- and where does that leave anybody who 's not .
Yeah , but who is n't Muslim , right .
Right .
I mean , and I guess there are some countries like Turkey is a Muslim country but has a sec- secular government --
Mhm .
-- and so that 's possible .
Oh , yeah .
I -- I guess it is .
But like you say , ah , you know , I -- they 're -- and -- and of course so many factors go into , um , how a -- a country is , um , um , what their resources are and everything else , you know .
They 're such a , um , a desert country --
Yeah .
-- that , um , they 've got a lot of -- o - of issues that they have to face every day that we do n't know anything about , that we --
Yeah .
-- ca n't fathom .
Mhm .
And i- you know , it - it 's -- it 's very difficult for someone sitting over here to make judgments upon them .
Right .
Just as it would be very difficult for them to sit over there and say , " Well , ah , you know , the United States is such a rich country and yet w- -- you know , we have our own problems right here at home .
