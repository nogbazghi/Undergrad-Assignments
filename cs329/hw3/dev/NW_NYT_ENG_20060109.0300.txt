Sheldon resident Nora Mendez has not voted in a
Mexican presidential election since coming to the United States nearly
three decades ago .
But by July 's election , the 50-year-old cafeteria cook from Cardenas , San
Luis Potosi , plans to mark an ' X ' over the name
of presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador -- and she 'll
do it from here in Texas .
In June , Mexico 's Congress allowed Mexicans living outside the country to
vote by absentee ballot for the first time in the
nation 's history .
" I cried , " Mendez said , recalling the moment she learned that she
could vote without having to return home .
On Saturday , in the midst of an Airline Drive flea market 's
live music and shopping , Mendez and more than 150 other
Mexicans registered to vote with the help from volunteers from
Houston 's Hispanic business community .
Hoping to encourage more Mexicans to vote , local business owners , union
activists and community leaders are registering voters at locations across
the city for free .
They are also trying to simplify a process in which --
according to Mexican election officials -- only about 12,000 of
the more than 4 million expatriates eligible to vote have
filled out their registration forms .
Nearly 300 Houston-area residents registered to vote at a recent soccer
game starring two Mexican teams at Reliant Stadium and at
the Mercado Sabadomingo flea market .
The Houston organizers also teamed
up with Austin leaders on Sunday to register nearly 150
voters there .
Mexican voters have until Sunday to register .
And area businesses popular with immigrants -- money-wiring agencies , Mexican restaurants
and music stores that sell Spanish-language CDs -- will offer
help with registration until Saturday .
On Saturday afternoon , Jose Luis Rodriguez and Enrique Lara , two area
business owners , will gather up all the registration forms and
hand-deliver them to the Federal Electoral Institute offices in Nuevo
Laredo , so voters do n't have to pay the fee to
send the documents by registered mail .
" I , as a citizen , wanted to support people so they would
vote from here , " said Rodriguez , as Mexican voters surrounded him
at the flea market Saturday and asked what documents they
needed to register .
Some people had not registered because voting is not a priority
among Mexican immigrants , said Gustavo Cano , a visiting assistant professor
at the University of Nebraska at Omaha .
" Mexicans who go to the U.S. , they go to work .
Or
they go because of family reasons , " said Cano , who has
studied political mobilization of Mexicans in Houston and Chicago .
They also did n't register until now because the process is complicated ,
said Rodriguez , who believes he and the other business leaders
are "pioneers " because his counterparts in other cities have not
led such a drive .
" I saw that there was a great barrier and I said ,
' Let 's take down those barriers , ' " said Rodriguez , president of
Botas Cebu , a company that sells work boots made in
Mexico .
Some of those barriers include the fee to send the documents
by registered mail and the institute 's list of directions , which
require copying both sides of a voter 's registration card .
" This could seem complicated to a lot of our paisanos because ,
honestly , a lot of them do n't know how to read , "
said Lara , who owns marketing company LaraNet .
Officials with Mexico 's electoral institute said they were happy Houston 's Mexican
business community is helping .
" It is marvelous to us that people are mobilizing like this , "
said Gerardo de Icaza , an institute official who oversaw the
registration drive on Saturday .
" It 's marvelous .
These are people engaged
in Mexico 's democracy . "
Local Mexican business leaders said they were not supporting any particular
political party or trying to influence the election .
They also
refused to mention how they would cast their votes .
