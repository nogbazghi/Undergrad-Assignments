Well , I asked him point blank , and he - and he danced around , and kind of I - I - you know , he did n` t really deny it , but did n` t talk about it , would n` t talk about it .
But I did go through other sources , and I do know that he met her .
He hugged her .
You know , he got to feed her .
He got to burp her .
She threw up on him , which is a welcome -you know , it` s the trifecta of - of parenthood .
And - and that she actually - I understand from that one witness - took both of her hands and grabbed his cheeks .
And I understand it was a seminal moment .
I think they`re slowly , real quickly , A.J. , getting her used to him .
So I think they know what` s coming down the pike .
What an emotional time that must have been .

I - I so appreciate you sharing this story with us tonight .
Always a pleasure , A.J. Thank you .
Now what may be startling new evidence that Larry Birkhead truly is the father of Anna Nicole Smith` s baby .
A facial-recognition company called PhoJoe has created a digital image of what Dannielynn might look like when she turns 18 .
And let me tell you , the resemblance between her and Larry Birkhead - startling .
With us tonight from Detroit , the director of PhoJoe , Emy Craciunescu ; and the artist who created the composite , Jovay Hayes ( ph ) .
Welcome to you both .
All right , Emy , last count - I got to tell you , it` s been really hard to keep up - but there are at least five men whose names have been tossed around as the potential father of Dannielynn .
What convinced you that Larry Birkhead is the likely daddy of Dannielynn ?
Well , based on about 60 photos that we analyzed and just put together - the artist , Jovay Hayes , sitting right here next to me , believes that - as well as I do - that Larry Birkhead is the father , mostly because of the eyes and the ears of Larry Birkhead .
Yes , and we`re - we`re looking at a picture of the - the digitally aged photo on the left of what she may look like when she` s 18 , and - and a more recent photo on the right .
And I want to take a look now at the eyes .
I want to compare the eyes of Birkhead and Dannielynn , like you say .
Jovay , it` s said the eyes are the window to a person` s soul .
What did you find by comparing the eyes ?
He shares a - or , yes , Dannielynn and him share the same eyes .
His eyes are wide-set apart , and very similar eye shape .
OK .
Now from the eyes , let` s go to Howard K. Stern` s eyes to the baby .
What did you conclude from this , Emy ?
Well , the color is different .
His - Howard K. Stern` s eyes are - a kind of a grayish blue , and Dannielynn as well as - as well as Larry Birkhead are like a - a sky blue color .
And the shape of Howard K. Stern` s eyes are - are quite different .
