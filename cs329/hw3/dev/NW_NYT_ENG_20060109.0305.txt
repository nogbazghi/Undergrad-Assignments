KEEPING THE PEACE IN FLIGHT , WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM ELMO
( Frequent Flier ) Gary E. Knell , chief executive of the Sesame
Workshop , a nonprofit educational group : As told to Christopher Elliott .
I recently found myself on a flight to Amsterdam with
a hyperactive 3-year-old boy , who darted up and down the
aisles and climbed on the seats while his mother watched
helplessly .
Remembering that I packed some goodies for television executives , I grabbed
an " ABC 's With Elmo " book and an Elmo plush toy ,
and approached the weary mother .
" I understand your situation , " I said , " I have four kids of
my own .
Maybe this will help . "
She offered a fatigued smile and passed Elmo off to her
son .
" Thank you , " she said , as the child settled in
his seat , clutching the doll and waiting for Mom to
read him a story .
Another time , during a stopover in Hamburg , Germany , a little girl
spotted the faces of Bert and Ernie on my carry-on
bag .
She pointed at my luggage excitedly , which was apparently
not acceptable behavior to her parents .
They apologized to me
in broken English about their child 's spontaneous outburst .
" You watch ' Sesamstrasse , " ' I said to the little girl , using the
German name for Sesame Street .
" And in America , we watch
' Sesame Street . " '
" Bert and Ernie live in America ? " she asked .
I opened my bag and handed her " The Best of Bert
and Ernie " in English .
With 120 countries taking part in Sesame 's work -- addressing important
issues like HIV in South Africa , girls ' education in Egypt
and tolerance in the Middle East -- I cover a
lot of ground , and meet a lot of children .
I
hand out a lot of goodies , too .
Sometimes to keep
the peace , and sometimes to build bridges .
The parents do n't know that I 'm Big Bird 's boss .
They only
know that their child has stopped crying .
Handing out the gifts has only one drawback : you run out
of presents .
When I showed up for a meeting in
Japan recently , without gifts after a long flight , I had
to make an emergency shopping trip to the toy store
to replenish my supply .
It is considered rude to come
to a meeting without a token of your appreciation .
But this time I remembered to buy a few extras .
You
never know when you might have to rescue another weary
parent on a plane .
