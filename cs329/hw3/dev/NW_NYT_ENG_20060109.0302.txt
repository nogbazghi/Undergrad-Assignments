Mesaba Airlines President John Spanjers said Monday that
he 's moving ahead to dramatically slash operating expenses , because "everything
that we 've seen from Northwest " signals that the big carrier
will take away all of Mesaba 's regional jets this year .
Just a few months ago , Mesaba operated a fleet of 100
planes for Northwest .
Now , Mesaba is developing a business plan
to survive with its fleet cut in half and limited
to 34-seat Saab turboprops .
" We have to secure our core business , " Spanjers said during an
interview at the airline 's headquarters in Eagan .
" Our focus is
putting together a cost restructuring plan that allows us to
support an operation of 49 Saabs . "
It was only two years ago that Mesaba looked poised for
growth .
Northwest had decided to keep 69-seat Avro regional jets in Mesaba 's
fleet , and Mesaba management had forged an agreement with the
Air Line Pilots Association and averted a strike .
By early
2005 , Mesaba was in an expansion mode because Northwest had
decided to give Mesaba a third type of aircraft : 44-
to 50-seat Canadair Regional Jets .
Now , bankrupt Northwest -- which owns or leases the aircraft that
Mesaba flies -- wants the regional carrier to slash its
operating costs and it expects to take the Avros out
of Mesaba 's fleet .
Spanjers said the two CRJs the airline
got last year likely will come out of the fleet
in the spring .
The forced downsizing was the chief reason the regional carrier filed
for a Chapter 11 reorganization Oct. 13 , Spanjers said .
But
Mesaba finds itself in an unusual situation , proceeding through bankruptcy
at the same time that Northwest , its main business partner ,
is restructuring .
Spanjers told employees recently that " Mesaba cannot wait for the Northwest
bankruptcy to come to a conclusion " before acting on its
own financial challenges .
In the three months since its bankruptcy filing , Mesaba has furloughed
95 employees .
The carrier , which flies out of the Twin
Cities , Detroit and Memphis hubs for Northwest , employs 3,707 people .
More layoffs are planned as Mesaba 's fleet shrinks .
And Northwest has left little doubt about how it views the
Avros that Mesaba flies .
" The four-engine Avros are very expensive to operate , especially in the
current high-fuel-cost environment , and will be removed from the fleet
as part of the Northwest bankruptcy process , " Northwest management said
in a newsletter to employees .
Nine Avros were taken out of service Oct. 31 .
Three more
came out last week , and the remaining 23 will be
phased out this year , Spanjers said .
He did not estimate how many layoffs might happen this year ,
but he stressed that he will pursue other opportunities beyond
Northwest 's Saab routes .
For example , he hopes to bid on
some regional flying for Continental Airlines .
Mesaba , Pinnacle Airlines -- Northwest 's other regional partner -- and U.S.
regional airlines have gotten a request for proposals from Northwest
for flying routes that can be served by jets seating
76 or fewer passengers .
Spanjers said the proposals are due
this month , and Mesaba will submit one that includes cost
breakouts for 50- and 70-seat jets .
He was not surprised that Northwest decided to " shop that business
and find who can do it at the lowest cost
that favors Northwest Airlines . "
The bidding process has upset Duane Woerth , president of ALPA International .
Last week , he told the Star Tribune that he will
pull out all the stops to hamper a race to
the bottom on pilot pay rates at regional carriers .
Northwest 's proposal process can be used by managements at a variety
of carriers to press for pilot concessions , but Woerth said
he 's working with ALPA units nationwide to block those attempts .
Spanjers is spending considerable time trying to reach labor agreements with
unions at Mesaba .
He is attempting to reduce labor costs
by 19.4 percent , with the reductions to come through pay
and benefit cuts and work rule changes .
Mesaba is still in negotiations with unions representing pilots , flight attendants
and mechanics .
Spanjers said the lower labor rates must be in place by
April 1 , and management will also be part of those
cutbacks .
The smallest union at Mesaba , the Transport Workers Union , has become
the first to ratify a new deal .
A six-year concessionary
agreement for its 35 members was approved Monday .
Perry Sprague ,
TWU Local 543 president , said 78 percent of those voting
approved the contract .
He did not release terms of the
pact .
" Even though we ratified the agreement , this is going to be
very difficult for our members financially , " Sprague said .
" But we
thought it would be better to try to come to
a consensual agreement instead of leaving the decision up to
a bankruptcy judge and Mesaba Airlines . "
Spanjers said the company is prepared to ask the court to
nullify contracts and impose new pay rates and work rules
if agreements ca n't be reached with other unions .
