I used to work for Boeing , but because of September eleventh I got laid off because nobody 's buying airplanes anymore .
Yeah .
Definitely not at the rate they were --
Yeah .
-- if at all .
Yeah .
Yeah .
No, we -- we were , ah , putting airplanes down in Arizona in the desert to mothball them , because that 's -- the air down there does n't rot them .
Oh , that 's interesting to know .
I did n't know that .
Yeah .
Yeah .
We -- well , we were building them and then all of a sudden people says , " Oh , we 're not buying them " .
Yeah .
And they backed out of their deal and the planes are built .
Yeah .
So --
Huh .
-- they put , put this white paint on them and stick them down in the desert .
Interesting .
You know , it like preserves them .
Yeah .
The dry air .
And the heat .
Uh-huh .
The constant heat .
Uh-huh .
That 's funny .
Yeah .
So , I 'm without a job .
Wow .
Therefore , I have no contact with anything anymore .
I sit home and play with my animals and let the world go by .
In fact --
That 's pretty --
-- I talked to a lady last week with this , um , and she 's in Iowa , and it was something about , you know , has anything changed since the September eleventh , and she 's in Iowa .
Nothing is different .
She 's on the farm , she has no idea that the -- what the world is going through , she does n't know anything about going security checks , and you know , and it was like , " Wow , that 's really amazing" .
And yet I 'm pretty naive right now too .
That 's interesting .
Well , I guess we 're -- I guess it all depends on where you are and what you -- what the , the life situations you are involved in could , ah , give you an idea as to what you may surround yourself with .
Right .
I know here in Southern California that 's all we deal with , is what 's going on in the world , so to speak .
Wow .
So we , ah , we 're pretty involved with -- are pretty surrounded by trying to figure out what 's going on --
Mhm .
-- and always keeping a tab on what 's going on .
Are you in it as , as a living , or just that that 's what 's going on ?
Um , basically that 's just what 's going on .
Yeah .
Yeah .
I know quite a few people who are over and involved in the conflict in Iraq , so it makes it sorta more personal --
Mhm .
-- to a sense of knowing somebody who 's over there and they may not come back and I may never see them again .
Right , right .
And all for the process of hopefully providing a stable country to the people who live there , and hopefully finding what they originally went in for , which was weapons of mass destruction , and proving that they had them and , and disposing of them .
