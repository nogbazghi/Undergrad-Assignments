joining us from Austin , Texas , is Lawrence Wright -- he 's the author of " The Looming Tower : Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11 ."
He 's also a staff writer at " The New Yorker " magazine .
And Vanda Felbab - Brown .
She 's a research fellow at the Brookings Institution .
President Bush has recognized the renewed strength of al Qaeda .
Listen to his remarks from last October , compared to what he said just last week .
Absolutely we 're winning .
Al Qaeda 's on the run .
Taliban and al Qaeda fighters do hide in remote regions of Pakistan .
This is -- this is wild country .
This is wilder than the Wild West .
And these folks hide , recruit and launch attacks .
Lawrence Wright , al Qaeda recruiting , regrouping rebuilding -- were all of the efforts over the last six years to smash al Qaeda for nothing ?
LAWRENCE WRIGHT , " The NEW YORKER , " AUTHOR , " THE LOOMING TOWER" : Well , John , you have to realize that in November , December of 2001 , al Qaeda was dead .
American and coalition troops swept aside the Taliban .
They pummeled al Qaeda .
Eighty percent of its members were captured or killed .
The leaders got away , but for three years , they wandered around like zombies , unable to communicate with each other , destitute , repudiated all over the world .
It was Iraq that brought al Qaeda back to life , and now it 's very much resurgent .
We eliminated the sanctuaries in Afghanistan , but now we see sanctuaries in North Africa , in the Sunni areas of Iraq , in the tribal areas of Pakistan .
So it 's very much on the march .
President Bush was referring to the tribal areas along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border known as Waziristan and South Waziristan .
The Pakistani government , though , is resisting this notion of a broad resurgence of al Qaeda .
Here 's what Mahmud Durrani , who is the Pakistani ambassador to the United Nations ( SIC ) , said to Wolf Blitzer about that on Monday .
There may be an odd place , and when we find out , we take it out .
We have done that recently .
But saying that they have reestablished themselves and they have a lot of compounds and they have rejuvenated -- that is incorrect .
Vanda , incorrect to say that they have reestablished or rejuvenated -- is the ambassador , with all respect , ignoring reality here ?
VANDA FELBAB-BROWN , BROOKINGS INSTITUTIO
It is absolutely correct that al Qaeda is rejuvenating , as is the Taliban .
And yes , they are using Pakistan as safe have ns , as important safe have ns .
In fact , we 've seen that after the conclusion of the peace treaties with tribal regions , both South and North Waziristan , these areas have become not only important hideout but increasingly important visible ( ph ) areas of both Taliban leadership and al Qaeda activity .
All right .
And Lawrence , was it that deal that Musharraf cut with the tribal leaders back in September in Waziristan and South Waziristan , as Vanda alluded to , that was responsible for that ?
" The Washington Post " certainly seems to think so .
Here 's what they said in an editorial on Wednesday .
Quote , " Mr.
Musharraf has done nothing .
Instead , he has continued to defend his deal with the Taliban and suggested that similar havens should be created in Afghanistan . "
