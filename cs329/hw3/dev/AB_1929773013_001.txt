Of course , the book is titled Understanding and Controlling Stuttering .
The first half of the book , the "understanding " part of it , is fantastic , and goes into deep detail .
The second half , which is supposed to reveal a " comprehensive new approach " can be summarized in one sentence : relax your butt hole .
I am not making this up ! !
The author is convinced that relaxing your anus will also relax the same part of your body that is keeping you from breathing and making you stutter .
I do n't think I have to tell you that his suggestion is bogus , although his reasoning is somewhat sound .
As another reviewer implied , the author molds the entire book around his hypothesis , as if begging you to believe him .
This book is pretty good for the "understanding " aspect , but the " controlling " aspect , read Self Therapy for the Stutterer instead , which has tried-and-true methods of control .
For those of you thinking of buying this book to find the miracle to cure your stuttering , this is n't it .
