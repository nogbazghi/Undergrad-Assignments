There` s , like , so many people working .
It does n` t mean that there` s still not some difficulty .
But there` s people behind the camera , director .
There` s people , like , producing .
There` s people , like - there` s - there` s many stars .
Casting director Twinkie Byrd agrees , and says the black film community has the power to change things .
They have to write and stop sitting around and waiting for people to write for us .
We have stories to tell ; let` s tell them .
What are we waiting for ?
We have money to pool together .
We - we have - we have people to pull together .
We have resources .
Let` s utilize them .
You want something , go get it .
Period .
So are black actors in Hollywood getting a fair shake ?
With us tonight from Hollywood , the Rev. Jesse Jackson , president of the Rainbow Push Coalition .
Welcome , Revered Jackson .
Good to be with you .
All right .
As we just heard , this year` s Oscar race includes five black actors among the nominees in the top categories .
And , you know , Reverend Jackson , many were huge winners at both the Golden Globes and last night` s Screen Actors Guild Awards .
What do you think ?
Are you satisfied ?
Well , that` s progress .
That is excitement .
It` s one of those huge moments .
You can think about the impact Denzel Washington has had , and this year , Will Smith and - and Whitaker and Eddie Murphy , Jennifer Hudson .
This is a big deal .
And it` s been a long time coming .
It shows we`ve never had a talent deficit , only an opportunity deficit in the infrastructure in the pipeline of writers and producers and screen directors and access to capital .
And while we will celebrate these winners this year and hope they will be real big winners on - on Oscar night , the study from UCLA shows 70 percent of all roles are written for white males , and 8 percent for African-Americans , and 5 percent for Latinos , 1 percent for Native Americans .
We must in fact demand more access to that pipeline .
To put it this way , Brooke : we did not know how good baseball could be until everybody could play .
We do n` t know how good performances can be until - until all can act and act in roles more natural .
Well - well , it` s very interesting because of the roles these actors who are getting recognition , the roles that they`re playing and that they`re winning for - Reverend Jackson , you`ve got Jennifer Hudson , a role based on one of the original Supremes ; Eddie Murphy playing a role based , you know , loosely on the late James Brown ; Forest Whitaker playing Ugandan dictator Idi Amin .
Even Will Smith playing a real guy in " The Pursuit of Happyness , " Chris Gardner .
These are real stories .
Is - is n` t what we need here good stories that are reflective of the black community ?
But , you know , it` s - and that` s a good thing .
And when some of these stories are there , screenwriters cannot get the job , or they cannot get access to capital .
And that is a big deal .
