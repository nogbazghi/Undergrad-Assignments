to the best of our ability , but to raise the
minimum wage 50 cents is really going to hurt me . "
A recently revised brief published by the California Budget Project shows
that the purchasing power of the state 's minimum-wage workers has
decreased by 33 percent since 1968 .
Jean Ross , executive director
of the nonprofit group that analyzes public policy with an
eye toward improving the lives of low-and middle-income people , said
the governor 's proposal still would leave minimum-wage workers 25 percent
short of their Lyndon Johnson-era standing .
" It would improve things , " Ross said , " but their purchasing power would
still be below what it was in 2002 ."
Accounting for inflation , Ross said minimum-wage workers would need a raise
of $ 1.11 by 2007 to get them back to where
they were at the time of their last increase four
years years ago .
But David Neumark , a University of California , Irvine , economist and senior
fellow with the Public Policy Institute of California , says his
research has shown that increases in the minimum wage ultimately
have the counterintuitive effect of increasing overall poverty by prompting
low-wage employers to lay off some of their workers .
" If you keep your job , you 're better off , " Neumark said .
" A
lot of people get raises , and a small number lose
their jobs , which turns out to be a bigger hit . "
On the idea of indexing , labor advocates cite the higher rates
that are being paid in states such as Washington and
Oregon , which have established formulas providing for annual minimum-wage raises .
Washington last year had a $ 7.35 hourly minimum , with the yearly
raises tied to inflation for urban wage earners and clerical
workers over the previous 12-month period .
In Oregon , the rate
was $ 7.25 an hour and an index tied to the
U.S. " city average " consumer price index .
Thanks to indexing , the two Pacific Northwest states had the highest
minimum-pay scales in the country .
Alaska came in third at
$ 7.15 ,
with California tied for fourth with New York , Connecticut
and Rhode Island , according to the U.S. Department of Labor .
The federal minimum wage is $ 5.15 .
Coupled with the high minimum wages in Washington and Oregon , however ,
are relatively higher unemployment rates .
In November 2005 , they checked
in with unemployment rates of 5.6 percent and 5.8 percent ,
respectively , according to the Labor Department 's figures for November .
Oregon 's
unemployment tied Tennessee for ninth-worst in the country behind hurricane-ravaged
Louisiana ( 12.4 percent ) and Mississippi ( 9.5 percent ) as well as
Michigan , South Carolina , Alaska , Massachusetts , Kentucky and the District of
Columbia .
Washington checked in next , at 5.6 percent .
California unemployment
stood at 5.2 percent in November .
The national rate decreased
to 4.9 percent in December , the Labor Department announced Friday .
In Sacramento , Republicans and business groups have taken a wary view
of the governor 's proposed increase .
" We understand there 's a need to compromise in this state , " said
California GOP Chairman Duf Sundheim .
He added , however , that the
party still has conceptual " concerns " about raising the minimum wage .
