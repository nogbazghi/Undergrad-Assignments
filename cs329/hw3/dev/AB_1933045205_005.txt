Coupled with Hans Richter 's : " Dada , Art and Antiart " and movement 's philosophy and works are clearly understood .
Graphics are truly great and commentary enlighten .
It might be noted this book is German published as the Max Ernst book " Life and Work" .
Both with numerous colored plates of the highest quality .
The Dada book though excels in text .
