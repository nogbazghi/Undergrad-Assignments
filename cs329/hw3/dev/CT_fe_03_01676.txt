It 's working .
Yeah , I think that would be one thing to do , like take the people in power out and then maybe things will start changing from there because it does n't seem to be just the general people over there , it 's like a - an abuse of power by , um , the ruling party , the whoever 's in power .
Mhm .
So do you think --
And -- uh-huh ?
Well , one of the things that they said on our little recording was do you think that they 'll be able to have peace there .
Does it seem to you that they will ?
I do n't think so , because it 's like there 's so much contention over even the land itself and , um , and there 's -- there 's oil over there , then there 's , uh , controversy about the Holy Land and the Jewish and , um , Muslim conflict over there so i- if they do , it 's going to take a really long time .
Yeah .
Yeah .
That 's what it seems like to me , too , although I hope you and I are both wrong .
Yeah , that would be great if they can achieve something over there and -- and everyone can come to an agreement and they could achieve some kind of stability at least over there .
If they could n't get total peace , maybe at least an agreement and some kind of way that they could work together on a common solution .
Mhm .
Yeah .
This is really hard to talk for ten minutes on a topic , is n't it ?
It is .
It is .
Oh , goodness and then it 's one that I do n't feel like I 'm all that knowledgeable about it and I 'm sure there 's people who have followed it from the beginning and know probably everything there is to know , but I just get bits and pieces .
Yeah .
Well , we - we 're too much alike in that regard .
Um , ...
But there 's been coverage out there right now .
I was in the post office today and I -- I think there were some Iraqis talking about how , um , they were upset to find out how many things Saddam had in his , uh , palace and apparently they were over there struggling and living in poverty and he 's drinking out of gold cups .
They did n't know that ?
Uh , not according to the CNN report .
They were surprised at -- at what they found because , um , from what I got out of the report , they saw the outside of the palace but they had no idea that it was just so lavish inside --
Oh , my goodness .
-- and all the things they had .
Well , it 's good for them to find out .
It is , and it 's really a shame when someone just takes all the resources of the country for themselves and has -- the person who 's supposed to be ruling has everything and the people have basically nothing .
