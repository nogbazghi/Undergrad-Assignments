The Giants will not play another game
for about seven months , until the preseason arrives in August ,
but their coach spent the morning after Sunday 's playoff loss
with the team 's star running back in a one-on-one film
session .
Tom Coughlin said he was angered by Tiki Barber 's choice of
words the night before , when Barber told reporters after the
team 's 23-0 loss to the Carolina Panthers that the Giants
were in some ways outcoached .
Barber 's punishment was akin to being called to the principal 's office .
Coughlin , bothered that Barber would single out the coaching staff
-- and , by extension , Coughlin -- used the replays to
show Barber the opportunities missed by players .
Barber , whose relationship with Coughlin is a vital bridge between the
coach and the rest of the team , emerged with a
broader view of the loss and the blame .
He never
quite took back his words , choosing to expand them rather
than retract them .
He and Coughlin apparently left their meeting on good terms .
Barber
seemed surprised at the fuss , and Coughlin seemed ready to
move on .
" We had a good conversation , " Coughlin said , declining to provide details .
" It is always a good conversation with Tiki .
He is
a very positive guy .
His attitude is great .
He said
something hopefully he regretted . "
Coughlin added : " We talked .
We looked at some tape together .
We
continued to talk .
And it ended up as it always
does , a unified situation .
Tiki has been a great , great
player here . "
What caught Coughlin 's attention Sunday was a news conference nearly an
hour after the game .
Barber , the NFL 's second-leading rusher , who
was held to 41 yards on 13 carries against Carolina ,
was asked how physical the Panthers had been on defense .
" I do n't think they were overly more physical than anyone else
we 'd played , " he said .
" I just think they had a
good scheme .
I think in some ways we were outcoached .
They had more intensity than we did , they played more
consistently than we did , and that 's why they won this
game . "
Other answers by Barber were sprinkled with references to Carolina 's scheme
and the Giants ' inability to make adjustments .
In noting that
receiver Plaxico Burress had no receptions -- the first time
that happened since 2000 , Burress ' rookie season in Pittsburgh --
Barber said , " That 's a testament to our game plan not
being the right one . "
Coughlin was not pleased .
" We win or we lose as a team , " Coughlin told reporters .
" And that is the way it shall remain .
We do n't
point fingers .
We handle these stressful situations with class and
distinction , or at least we try to . "
Coughlin added that sometimes people spoke out of frustration or without
appropriate forethought .
" From time to time it is important , again , to re-emphasize to
our players that we can handle any form of adversity
there is , as long as we remain together and we
move forward together , " he said .
Before Coughlin addressed the news media for his season post-mortem , Barber
stood at his locker and talked about the team 's loss
and its outlook for next season .
About half of the roughly 30 questions Barber faced were about
the episode with Coughlin .
Barber amended his previous day 's answers ,
saying that the Panthers had "out-everythinged " the Giants .
He said
the meeting with Coughlin gave him a bigger perspective .
" I had n't seen the film , " Barber said .
" So when I talked
to him , we just started looking at it .
It was
a lot of execution .
It was a lot of them
making plays and us not . "
He added that the Giants "were outplayed more than anything . "
" Their players did better than ours , " he said .
" That shows up
on film . "
With the relationship apparently patched up , Coughlin and Barber may have
to agree to disagree .
Coughlin was asked if the coaches
could have devised a better offensive scheme against the Panthers .
" No , I really wish I could say that , " he replied ,
offering examples of plays that were unsuccessful because of missed
assignments or tipped balls .
Barber budged , but he did not entirely accept Sunday 's postgame comments .
" It probably was a mistake , because you guys are still talking
about it , " Barber told reporters .
" It is what it is .
I was feeling that way after the game .
Whether it 's
right or not -- probably not -- because looking at
the tape it was mostly us not performing as players . "
