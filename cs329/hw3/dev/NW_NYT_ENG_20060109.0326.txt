Make his tie green instead of red
and put the room at Hofstra University instead of Arrowhead
Stadium .
This could have been a Herman Edwards news conference
with the Jets .
Edwards stood behind a lectern Monday afternoon and invoked the familiar
themes from his five seasons in New York : faith , trust ,
integrity , sacrifice , commitment and accountability .
He addressed reporters as " sir "
and "ma'am " and seemed to have an answer for everything ,
except what everyone wanted to know : Why was he here ,
being introduced as the Kansas City Chiefs ' head coach , just
six days after saying , " I intend to be back as
the Jets ' coach " ?
Before taking questions , Edwards said he would not discuss his departure
from the Jets , who on Friday accepted a fourth-round draft
choice in exchange for letting Edwards out of the final
two years of his contract .
" I believe in family , " Edwards said .
" And what happened in New
York stays in New York .
So if you ask any
questions about what happened , I 'll tell you right now , it
stays in the family .
" I learned a long time ago , what stays in your house
stays in your house .
It 's in that house , and I
threw the key away . "
When Edwards did speak about the Jets and New York , it
was only in positive terms .
As his wife , Lia , held
their 5-month-old daughter , Gabrielle , in her lap , Edwards thanked the
Jets ' owner , Woody Johnson , for hiring him and for letting
him return to Kansas City , where he served as an
assistant coach and scout from 1990 to 1995 .
" I owe a debt of gratitude to Woody Johnson , " Edwards said .
" He gave a young coach a chance to be a
head coach when maybe a lot of people would n't do
that .
I thank him for that , and I thank the
organization for that ." And
I thank my players my last five
years in New York for making me a better man .
I hope I made a difference , and I hope I
make a difference here . "
Edwards agreed to a four-year deal reportedly worth $ 12 million , about
$ 1 million more a season than he made with the
Jets .
With the Jets , he was among the lower-paid head
coaches in the NFL .
Job security may have been a bigger concern for him .
Though
the Jets extended his contract twice , the second time after
the 2003 season , Edwards faced an uncertain future .
If the
Jets struggled again next season -- a strong possibility with
workhorse back Curtis Martin and quarterback Chad Pennington coming off
injuries -- Edwards would enter the final year of his
contract as a lame duck .
The Jets ' 4-12 mark this season dropped his record as coach
below .500 ,
at 39-41 .
But he departed as the only
Jets coach to make the playoffs three times , and his
39 victories tied Walt Michaels for third in team history .
Edwards ' news conference concluded a tumultuous final six days to his
Jets career .
Dick Vermeil announced his retirement as head coach
on Jan . 2 , and the Chiefs ' president , Carl Peterson , said
Jets General Manager Terry Bradway called the next day to
ask if he was interested in talking to Edwards .
That
was the day Edwards said he was staying .
Then the
Jets agreed to release Edwards from his contract .
Peterson 's relationship with Edwards goes back to 1972 , when Peterson , then
an assistant at UCLA , recruited Edwards out of high school .
Edwards spurned the Bruins for California .
" I was a little bit of a rebel , " Edwards said .
Five years later , when he was Philadelphia 's director of player personnel ,
Peterson signed Edwards , a defensive back , as a rookie free
agent .
Peterson became the Chiefs ' president in December 1988 , and
the next year Edwards joined the team as part of
the NFL 's minority coaching fellowship program , becoming a scout in
1990 .
Edwards is believed to be the first graduate of
the program to become head coach of the team he
served .
" I have waited to do this for a long time , " Peterson
said .
" I was very fortunate .
I got to hire the
guy who hired me , Dick Vermeil .
And we had the
opportunity to hire somebody we 've known for a long time . "
Vermeil was 44-36 in five seasons , but Kansas City had only
two winning records in that time and one playoff appearance ,
losing to Indianapolis , 38-31 , in a divisional game in the
2003 season .
Edwards inherits a team that finished 10-6 and missed the playoffs
despite having the top-ranked offense in the league , led by
running back Larry Johnson ( 1,750 yards , 20 touchdowns ) , the seven-time
Pro Bowl tight end Tony Gonzalez and an offensive line
that landed three players in the Pro Bowl .
" I think they upgraded the act , " Vermeil said .
" He 's getting a
better team .
That does n't guarantee anything , but the talent level
here is far superior than when I got here . "
