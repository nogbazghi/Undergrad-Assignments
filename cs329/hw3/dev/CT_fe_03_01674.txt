Yeah .
-- and , uh , displacement of people who were already there .
Yeah , and a - --
How do you feel about that ?
About the Israeli occu- occupa- -- well , with , um , you know , just -- I do n't know if you 're very familiar with , like , beginning of time , how , like , you know , Israel being God 's chosen people and that sort of thing ?
Are you very aware of , like , the -- the biblical history there ?
I 'm -- I 'm aware of it , but more like a comic book .
It does n't -- I mean , I 'm -- I 'm a --
Okay , it 's not really a --
I 'm a -- I 'm a scientist and so it -- it -- it really does n't , um , it does n't mean much to me , you know ?
Okay .
Well , just because you 're a scientist does n't have to -- I mean , it 's not -- but , I mean , historically --
No, but -- so -- so if , uh , well , what do you mean , historically ?
So , I -- I mean , there were other people on the earth --
Yeah .
Oh , oh , definitely .
-- when it --
Yeah , w- whenever --
Right ?
-- I say God 's ch - -- yeah , yeah , whenever I say God 's chosen people I do n't mean they 're the only ones that are going to go to heaven or anybody -- no , I do n't mean that at all .
Um , but I do n't know if you , like , if you 've ever read as far as , like , in , you know , the beginning of ti- -- in , you know , in , like , Genesis and Exodus .
I do n't know if you 've ev- are very familiar with , like , those , but how it talks about how God chose the people of Israel as his chosen -- chosen people , and as far as the conflict there , like , they were taken out ?
Uh-huh .
And I -- I 'd really -- I ca n't -- I 'm not -- I know the history but to go through it , it would take forever [several inaudible words ] .
So you really feel that , like , the -- the current conflict in Palestine is -- is -- is -- is somehow related to what -- what the Torah says or -- or , uh , or what the New Testament says ?
I -- I mean , is that a -- really a rational belief on your part ?
Well , okay , I -- I ca n't say that , like , " Okay , what 's happening in this verse is like the prophesy is coming true " .
But , I mean , I think in -- because , in my belief , God 's in control of everything and he 's planning out everything , you know ?
In his plan , he knows what 's going on , he knows what 's happening .
So , okay , it may be another -- thousands and thousands of years before actually I b - -- that God does come back , but I believe what 's happening now , it does play into a part .
It 's kind of like just a sequence of events , I guess .
It 's kind of like I said earlier , a precursor , and I -- I do believe that as far as what 's going on now , yeah , it is , it 's a rational belief .
I mean , I think -- and you would even hear a lot of stories , a lot of scientists kind of -- there is evidence that would support that also .
