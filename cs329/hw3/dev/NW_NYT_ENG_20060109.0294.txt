Records showing how thoroughly the Internal Revenue Service audits big corporations
and the rich , and how much it discounts the additional
taxes assessed after audits , are being withheld from the public
despite a 1976 court order requiring their disclosure , according to
a legal motion filed last week in federal court in
Seattle .
For decades , the information was given at no charge to a
professor at Syracuse University , Susan B. Long , who made it
available on the Internet at trac.syr.edu , with tools for people
to conduct their own analyses .
Much of what the public knows about the efficiency , effectiveness and
evenhandedness of the revenue service and other big federal agencies
is based on the figures that Long collects and posts .
In May 2004 , the service told her that it would not
provide the information and ordered its statisticians to stop answering
her questions .
It also advised her that if it ever
did make the data public again , the information would cost
$ 12,000 a month to receive electronic copies .
Long , whose suit resulted in the court order in 1976 , when
she lived in Seattle , asked the federal court there to
enforce that order , which instructed that the data be turned
over without charge .
Eric M. Stahl of Davis Wright Tremaine
in Seattle , who is handling the case without charge , said
the earliest hearing date would be Jan .
27 .
The senior national spokesman for the tax agency , Frank Keith , wrote
to Long in June 2004 that he had lawyers examine
her assertion that the agency was required to provide the
data .
After extensive research , Keith wrote , the lawyers concluded that
no court order existed and that "accordingly , the IRS is
not in violation of any standing injunctions . "
Long responded by sending Keith a copy of the order .
Keith
said no one now at the agency was aware of
it .
" We thought we were providing this information voluntarily , " he said .
The agency has no plans to release the information , Keith said
Friday .
He argued that Long 's latest requests went far beyond
the order , covering costly detailed information that could inadvertently allow
the identification of specific taxpayers .
Long said that was false .
" There is no change in what
we have asked for , and they know it , " she said .
" The IRS simply has no regard for court orders , " Long said ,
adding that other federal agencies whose information she collects are
also obstructing her .
Researchers , reporters , lobbyists and others have argued that government agencies have
for several decades become less open .
That perception accelerated after
the Sept. 11 attacks , drawing complaints from , among others , Sen.
John Cornyn , R-Texas .
President Bush signed an executive order last month " to ensure appropriate
agency disclosure of information . "
In a meeting with newspaper editors
last April , the president said , " The presumption ought to be
that citizens ought to know as much as possible about
the government decision making . "
A spokesman for the White House , Trent Duffy , said he was
unaware of the problems that Long raised but that he
would look into "agency specific complaints . "
Keith said political appointees played no role in the decision to
withhold the data .
" Decisions regarding the information to be made available to Professor Long , "
Keith said , "have routinely and consistently been made by career
employees concerned only with how much of an administrative burden
is involved , how much taxpayer money are we spending to
meet this . "
Among the withheld information are figures on how many hours are
devoted to audits of large corporations and rich individuals , a
basic measure of the thoroughness of the audits .
Among other findings , Long 's information has shown that in 1999 the
poor were more likely than the rich to be audited .
David Burnham , co-director with Long of the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse ,
which collects raw government data , said the withheld information made
it impossible to evaluate the intensity of audits .
Burnham noted
that the withheld data included figures that indicated how much
auditors say is owed in extra taxes , but that the
tax agency lets taxpayers negotiate down .
" It is simply impossible to evaluate the IRS without this data , "
Burnham said , " and they know it . "
