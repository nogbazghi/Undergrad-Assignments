no offense to john dean or his friends , but i 'm struggling to picture a tanking - gonzales replaced j-ass , who held morning prayer meet ups when not tossing drape cloths over statues . he came off like the fussy client of doris day 's in pillow talk - the 1 that 's obsessed with a small statue until she discovers it is a cambodian fertility god .
now on the efforts to circumvent the legally required archiving sytem that would keep a record of all white house e-mails , karl rove and others were doing white house business in their g .o.p . accounts .
truthout reports that the white house is now insisting that before such e-mails are turned over to congress , the white house be allowed to see them first .
they gave up that right when they used g .o.p . accounts .
they made the choice to use political party accounts and they ca n't now come in ( or should n't be allowed to ) and say , 'that may have official white house business ! ' i 'm sure it does .
i 'm also sure that official white house business is legally supposed to be conducted via the white house e-mail accounts .
when they broke the law , they gave up the right to claim 'executive priv. ' ap reports that the democratic party is suing the republican party saying that the e-mails must be turned over to congress .
and that 's about all the cess pool i can handle in 1 morning .

Chaos and violence continue , the US military announces the death of another service member , "development " passes for an answer in Baghdad ( " Time-shares " is next ) , Helga Aguayo explains the status of her husband ( war resister Agustin Aguayo ) , and Bobby Gates finally gets to act out his long held dream to be Marisa Tomei .
" The investigating officer said that it was in the best interest of the military to discharge him and that he believed that Agustin was sincere .
However , higher ups in the chain of command -- that never met with my husband -- decided that he was n't sincere and just did n't really give a reason , just said that he did n't qualify as a conscienious objector , " Helga Aguayo speaking to Amy Goodman ( Democracy Now ! ) today .
Helga Aguayo sketched out
how her husband came to see the illegal war as immoral while serving in Iraq , how he attempted to receive CO status , the obstacles there and a great deal more including the the convictions of missing movement and desertion .
On the latter , she noted that it "is unheard of for people that are gone less than thirty days -- soldiers that are gone less than thirty days . "
Aguayo was gone from September 2nd through September 26th .
The rule of thumb is that if you are gone less than 30 days , desertion is n't even a possible charge .
Not only was Aguayo gone less than 30 , he turned himself in .
Helga Aguayo explained how the two felony convictions mean trigger an automatic appeal :
