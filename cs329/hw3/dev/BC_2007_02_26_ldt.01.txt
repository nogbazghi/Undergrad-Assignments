Kitty , more than 29 hours now into deliberations and the judge has made a very strong statement .
He would rather go with fewer jurors than set this process back .
Showing obvious disappointment , Judge Reggie Walton declares about one juror , " ...what she had exposure to obviously disqualifies her . "
A reference to information on the case the juror had received outside the courthouse .
With that , a woman who 'd worked as a museum curator is thrown off of the jury and not replaced , despite the concerns of prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald , who worried out loud that the pool is getting dangerously low .
The judge 's reason for not seating an alternate ?
He did n't want to start from scratch and waste more than two days of deliberations .
The fate of former vice presidential aide Lewis " Scooter " Libby , charged with lying to investigators about the leak of a CIA 's officer 's covert identity , now in the hands of 11 people .
It 's certainly unusual to have a verdict from 11 jurors , but it 's not unprecedented , and it 's certainly treated the same way as the verdict would be from 12 .
It 's unclear what kind of information the juror , who 's now an arts researcher , was exposed to , but she has gone her own way before in this case .
On Valentine 's Day , when jurors came in wearing identical red T-shirts , and one read a note of thanks to the judge , she was the only one who did n't play along .
And in jury selection , she told of being mugged in Washington .
And said when she later recognized her mugger on the streets , she did not notify the police because , quote , " I would have lost my whole day of research at work to probably no avail . "
She 's also something of a character .
She was self assured .
She was different from a lot of the jurors , and she really stood out in refusing to wear a Valentine 's shirt .
All those things made her a point of considerable interest .
Now when the judge first heard about this juror 's exposure , he feared that whatever information it was might have tainted the other jurors .
After interviewing them and speaking to the jury foreperson , he concluded it had not .
But he emphatically warned the panel again not to have contact with any outside information -- Kitty .
Brian , OK , stay with us for a second .
And for more on how all this could affect the trial , we 're joined by CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin .
Jeffrey , what do you make of this ?
And what is the significance of this development ?
Is this case in any way compromised by the diminished jury ?
No, the defense agreed with removing her , in fact , enthusiastically saw her -- wanted her off of the jury .
So they 've waived any objection in case this case -- in case there 's a conviction and they have to appeal .
What 's curious to me is that the defense usually wants eccentrics , holdouts .
And the defense wanted her off the jury .
That may be because there was something about her they did n't like , or it may be that the alternates looked more pro-prosecution .
