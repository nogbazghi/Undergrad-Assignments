When I first saw this book I was immediately excited .
The rich dad philosophy directed specifically at women ? ?
Where do I sign up ?
But then I started reading ... and kept waiting for it to get better .
Then I told myself I would give it one more chapter and then one more .
It never did .
This book was just plain bad .
It was not only bad but the book undermined my intelligence .
Are there really women out there who do n't even know the bare minimum basics of investing and money ?
And if they do n't , do they also need some long drawn-out narrative story with cliche "women stories " just to keep them interested ?
This book was just plain terrible .
There is very little actual investing information .
It 's basically a lot of cliche money advice sprinkled in with Kim 's extensive story of her and her girlfriends ' quest to become financially free ( which honestly bored me to death and also made me question how someone like Kim Kiyosaki managed to find a fan club of women who know even less about money than she does that she can preach to ) .
I also could n't believe that Robert co-signed on this book !
( He had to have , right ? )
Why did n't he tell her how bad it was or at least how she could fix it !
I mean it 's easy to see what they wanted to do with this book .
Let 's empower women and teach them how to take the initiate with their money and not leave it all up to a man ...We get it .
But come on , it 's 2008 , give us women a little more credit .
We 're not idiots .
We know what CASHFLOW means Kim ! ? ! I know I was harsh in this review but it was only because I really expected a lot more from this book and really really wanted to like it .
( I really did . . )
