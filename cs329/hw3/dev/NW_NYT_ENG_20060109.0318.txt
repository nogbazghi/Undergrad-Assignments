Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger joked to reporters on
Monday morning about the badly swollen lip he suffered in
a motorcycle accident a day earlier , but found himself facing
more serious questions about his driver 's license later in the
day .
The governor , through a spokeswoman , admitted he never obtained the M-1
or M-2 endorsement on his license that he needed to
legally drive a two-wheel motorcycle on the street -- despite
the fact that he 's done so for years .
Press Secretary Margita Thompson said the governor did have the appropriate
Class C license for operating a motorcycle with a sidecar ,
as he did on Sunday when he collided with a
neighbor 's vehicle .
But Schwarzenegger , 58 , rode a motorcycle without a sidecar in his
" Terminator " movies , and he 's often described his Sunday afternoon motorcycle
rides along Pacific Coast Highway with friends like actor Tom
Arnold and director James Cameron .
California Highway Patrol have accompanied him on those rides , and the
governor 's spokeswoman said CHP officers were with him on Sunday .
Tom Marshall , CHP spokesman , declined to say how it was that
Schwarzenegger managed to avoid securing the proper licensing despite his
close contact with the CHP.
The governor 's spokeswoman said she checked on Schwarzenegger 's driver 's license on
Monday in response to a question from KFI-AM radio in
Los Angeles .
She said the governor said he had a
European license that allowed him to ride a motorcycle in
this country when he came to America in 1968 , but
she was n't sure it was still valid .
" There was nothing wrong with what he did yesterday , " she said .
" He has a Class C license , which allows him to
legally drive a motorcycle with a sidecar attached . "
But she conceded that he most likely took years of illegal
motorcycle rides because he 'd never secured the M-1 or M-2
endorsement .
" He acknowledges he needs to get it , " she said .
Thompson said she 's not sure when -- or how -- the
governor will get the M-1 or M-2 endorsement because "everyone
in the office is focused on the budget right now . "
Obtaining a M-1 or M-2 endorsement requires passing a Department of
Motor Vehicles skill test or providing a certificate of completion
of motorcycle training from a CHP-approved course .
The test , among other things , asks riders to demonstrate they can
"adjust speed and position to the traffic situation , " and to
"accelerate , brake and turn safely . "
It was not immediately clear Monday night what penalties drivers may
face for failure to obtain the proper endorsement .
(STORY CAN END HERE )
In Sunday 's accident , Schwarzenegger said he was driving his Harley Davidson
motorcycle , with 12-year-old son , Patrick , in a sidecar , with both
of them wearing helmets .
He said a neighbor appeared to see the motorcycle , then looked
the other way and backed her vehicle into the street
in his path .
He said he was going 20 miles per hour but could n't
stop in time to avoid a collision .
Schwarzenegger said he rode the motorcycle home , realized he 'd cut his
lip and went with his son to the emergency room ,
where doctors used 15 stitches to repair his cut .
" What normally happens when you see someone in Hollywood with swollen
lips , it 's collagen shots , " he said , referring to a cosmetic
procedure .
" This is not what it is .
It 's not plastic
surgery or anything like that .
It 's just simply an accident
with a motorcycle . "
He said the doctor told him he should n't speak for three
days -- and joked that his wife , Maria Shriver , suggested
he be silenced for seven days .
" She hates motorcycles , " he said .
" And she hates me skiing fast
and she hates all the things that I do that
are dangerous , but that is just the way it is . "
Schwarzenegger also had a motorcycle accident in December 2001 , when a
car stopped in front of him and he was unable
to stop in time to avoid it .
His chest hit
the motorcycle windshield , and he broke six ribs and was
hospitalized for four days .
Asked Monday if he would consider giving up his motorcycle rides ,
he indicated no interest in abandoning any of his daredevil
activities .
" I never stuck to the rules because , you know , I think
that is what life is about is to be out
there , " he said .
