This is a fine book and tells some cool thing about bicycle powermeters .
It introduces some usefull concepts , like the normalized power , TSS.
You 'll understand some capabilities of the limit-less tool called powermeter .
It shows how to use an powermeter beyond the ordinary .
You 'll learn some nice stuff .
But the author does n't give away their gold .
It looks like their real secret - the training sessions - are kept away .
They begin to show some exercise sessions for some kind of purpose , but they do n't show you a lot .
I felt like they were writing an teaser , not the full movie .
They also tell a lot about the Cycling Peaks software , which is good , but not all that great .
I prefer to combine the Cycling Peaks with the original SRM or Powertap softwares to get the most juice .
They tried to keep this book from being an big ad and they pretty much accomplished that .
I did n't get angry , nor got crazy to go buy their software after reading the book .
