We really do , we really do .
And we do n't give a lot back .
Mhm .
At least not over there .
Of course , we ca n't even help our -- noone even helps their fellow neighbors these days .
Mhm .
Everyone kinda keeps to themselves .
It 's kinda sad .
Well we -- I live on campus in family housing , and it 's really nice 'cause we 're all just , like , one nice little community here .
Oh , yeah .
Definitely .
We 're all in the same boat .
We 're all poor college students trying to raise families .
So , it 's fun .
We 'll have barbecues and we 're , like , okay , " We 're barbecuing , come on and join us , " you know , it 's really nice , you know , we all know what 's going on and , you know , whoever has babies they got meals all lined up , and --
Oh my goodness .
So how old are your children ?
I have a two and a half year old and a nine month old .
Oh , you 're got to be young then .
Yeah , I 'm only twenty four .
Yep.
You 're young .
You 're our oldest child 's age .
I 'm my parents ' oldest child .
Are you really ?
Yeah , I am .
That 's kinda weird , is n't it ?
Yeah .
But , you know , they would n't change it for the --
So what 's your middle name ?
Anne .
Mine 's Pamela Elaine .
Wow .
That 's funny .
Usually I hear people call themselves Pam , or something else .
I , ah , -- y- --
People usually call me Pammy Jo .
I always like Pamela , when people call me Pam I 'm like , oh , " It 's Pamela" .
I like Pamela .
I like that .
I -- well , I was the radio DJ for a couple of years , and I was known by Pamela .
So that was --
You were a radio DJ ?
Mhm .
Oh , my goodness .
Yeah .
I loved it .
Talking to a celebrity .
But now I 'm a stay at home mom .
Oh , yes .
And that takes a lot of work .
Yeah .
It is -- oh , my good - especially when they 're both sick .
Yes .
Well , I 'll tell you , you 'll want 'em both to have chicken pox at the same time .
I hope .
It 's easy to do .
But it 's real hard when they 're both sick .
Huh ?
It sure is hard when they 're both sick .
Because --
Yeah ?
-- I do n't have family nearby .
But it 's good to get it done and over with in one swoop .
So , my two year old had her tonsils out , and then a few days later my nine month old , she 's been dealing with some really bad reoccurring ear infections , that we 're end up in the hospital every day getting them suctioned out and getting a shot for antibiotics .
