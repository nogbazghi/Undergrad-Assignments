Yeah , I do n't know if it 's outdoors as in roughing it , or if it 's just -- I think maybe like a settlement , like an area .
I 'm hoping they have some kind of facility , but , um , -- yeah .
So would I. Nothing like the Japanese Americans or African Americans or anything like that .
I 'm hoping they have a nice place .
Mhm .
Japanese Americans have what ?
Oh , like , back in the , ah , World War Two , I think it was --
Mhm .
-- how the Japanese Americans got stuck in all these camps , and --
Oh , yeah , the internment camps .
Argh .
Yeah , they had everything taken away from them .
So , ... hm .
Think there 's any other problems in the Middle East ?
Um , um , I just think the biggest problem is a clash of , ah , the cultures , clash of civilizations , and , ah , we have to be careful --
Yeah .
-- not to impose our way on other people .
And not try to get too involved .
Mhm .
Just , like , help them a little bit when they need them -- when they need it , but do n't try to get too involved and do n't try to help them too much , because then they 'll start relying on you , and when you end up having to draw back , due to probably politics or something like that --

Peace and Middle East conflict .
Yeah , war bad , peace good .
Yes .
" I do n't want to die .
Mommy . "
Um , ...
Um , ...
I think we have one minute left .
One minute ?
You 're timing it ?
I just looked at the clock .
I do n't know --
Oh .
-- I do n't know when we started talking , but I know I got a call right on the hour .
But I do n't know when we connected .
So I think we have a minute or two left .
I 'm just muttering around , I 'm not sure what to say .
Where are you , anyway ?
I 'm in Philadelphia .
Whoa --
Where are you ?
-- I 'm in Washington .
Washington DC ?
Nope , the other Washington .
Other side --
The state ?
-- of -- yeah .
Really ?
Yeah .
Oh , my goodness .
Wow .
Yeah , I 'm near Seattle and Puyallup .
That 's really far .
I , I had no idea this was a national survey .
I know .
It 's probably world wide .
Oh , my goodness .
Freakish .
That 's , um , pretty impressive .
