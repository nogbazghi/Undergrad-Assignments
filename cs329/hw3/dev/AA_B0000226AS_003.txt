I have owned my Turbo II vacuum for a number of years now , and I will admit that I was never willing to spend the money for these attachments .
It is true that there are many lesser vacuums out there that include the tools , but I always told myself that I would rather have an awesome shop vac and no tools versus a so-so vac with tools .
Recently , I finally coughed up the money for these attachments and I am thrilled to have so much more versatility when using a favored tool .
I have had absolutely zero problems with any of the attachments .
It is true that there are no "positive lock " mechanisms on the mating pieces , yet I have never had the attachments come apart even after hours of continuous use .
I have cleaned our cars , sucked up sawdust , and vanquished cobwebs all to my great satisfaction .
The adjustable "bristles " on the floor attachment make pulling stuff off of carpet ( such as dust/dirt/woodchips in a car trunk ) a painless task .
<p>If there is a downside , it is the lack of a convenient way to store these tools "onboard " the Turbo II machine ( as some other shop vacs offer ) .
For now I am keeping the attachments in a drawer and the metal extension wands lean in a corner .
But I guess this is more my problem than a criticism of this tool set .
Overall I am thrilled with the performance of this product and I recommend its purchase without reservation !
