The lawyer stands up and says to Ann Taylor during her cross-examination , tell the jury about your back injury when you were 16 years old .
In fact , the attorney for State Farm raised questions about Ann Taylor falling off a horse when she was in high school .
And the lawyer also asked Taylor , a nurse , about throwing out her back when she moved a patient .
The attorney even brought up personal things that Ann Taylor had to sell a horse , that Ann Taylor had to sell her house , that Ann Taylor had even broken up with a longtime boyfriend , and could n't all these things add to stress and that could have caused her back pain ?
They did n't have any expert testimony .
They never had a physician look at me .
They tried to make you out to be a liar .
Exactly .
The attorney for State Farm did produce one piece of evidence , very large photos of two slightly damaged cars .
They expected the jury to see those and to say , she really was n't hurt .
Michael Freeman is a crash expert , often called in to testify when insurance companies are trying to use photos to deny a crash victim was injured .
How do the insurance companies use photos ?
Well , take a look at a photo of a car with minimal damage , he says , and convince the jury what they probably were already thinking .
That does n't look like much .
How could that person be hurt ?
You 're eventually being judged by what your car looks like , not by what your doctor says or by what the impact of a particular crash has had or injury has had on your life .
That 's not fair .
It 's not right .
It 's fraud .
What stunned Taylor in the end is that State Farm 's strategy worked .
The jury did n't believe she was hurt .
They awarded her just $ 1,500 , less than what State Farm originally offered .
We contacted three of the jurors .
They said this photo played a big part in their verdict .
And they thought the insurance company had already paid its share and Taylor was only trying to get more .
Why did they look at her and must have assumed this lady is trying to rip off the insurance companies , she 's a fraud .
When she walked in the courtroom and she walked to the jury box and she walked to the testimony box and she walked out of the courtroom at lunch and at the end of a day , they assumed that she was not significantly injured .
It 's a case straight out of the McKinsey playbook , the three D's .
By denying her claim , State Farm forced Taylor to hire an attorney and sue .
After a three-year delay , Taylor walked into a courtroom with no noticeable pain .
And by defending the case for years , State Farm forced her attorney to front expensive litigation costs , which in the end he did n't get back .
They make these cases so expensive to litigate that attorneys wo n't want to take them .
Indianapolis superior court judge David Dreyer says he hears it from his colleagues across the country , courts bogged down with minor impact cases .
He says the insurance companies ' own lawyers admit to him they 're being forced to drag the cases out .
