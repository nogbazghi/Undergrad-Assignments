Right .
-- regard - regarding this .
Right .
I think we 're looking at more for an overall peace picture of getting along with each other in a society , not necessarily our turmoi- -- our in- inner turmoils .
Otherwise we can say , " Absolutely not , we are too human to ever resolve all of our issues " .
Well spoken .
Well said .
I like that .
I 'm going -- I 'm going to use that in some other conversations down the line .
Yeah , I do n't know .
I just -- I was , you know , a little shocked when they went in and heard some of the things they found with the torture sites and the decomposing bodies and -- and you have to figure , you know , if it takes a few lives to end as much of that kind of inhumane treatment that was going onto these people , then you have to agree to some level that you ca n't say , " It 's not my problem" .
It is our world .
Yes , it is -- it is our world and one of the other questions they brought along in this introduction was that do we -- do we continue the role of policeman --
Mhm .
-- to which I say , " Heck , yeah" , because nobody else is stepping up --
That 's right , until they can --
-- stepping up to the bat .
Right .
I agree with that .
I mean are we -- are we going to count on the French for anything ?
Heck , no , and we should n't allow the French to step in for anything .
They did n't want to be involved in it .
Now the only reason they 'd want to be involved in anything is for the financial gain they might perceive coming their way from it .
Oh , most definitely , I -- most definitely .
I agree with you there , but now --
-- we 'll see how --
But we 're too diplomatic and we 'll have to say , " Well , we need , you know , our NATO friends --"
Yes , we --
"-- we need to get everything back intact again" , so we 'll have to bury the hatchet and of course allow them to get back involved .
We -- we -- we have the overwhelming urge , as I 'll put it , in this country , the overwhelming urge and need to be nice --
Right .
-- which is prob - -- which raises a lot of questions with me because over the years I 'm not sure how nice I 've been in various encounters , but I find myself less nice as we go along .
Right .
Hardened through life , though , unfortunately .
It 's the experiences that create it , not the attitude , not the willingness to -- you know , our less willingness , shall we say , to maintain the niceties .
Sometimes even in the raising of our own children --
-- sometimes someone just has to say no .
