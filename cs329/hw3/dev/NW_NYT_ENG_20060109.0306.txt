A private equity group 's planned $ 12 billion takeover of
a Danish telecommunications company , TDC , was thrown into doubt on
Monday when the company 's largest investor , a pension fund , said
it opposed the deal because the offer was too low .
The deal , which would be Europe 's largest private equity takeover , was
subject to shareholder approval and was expected to close this
week .
Now that the pension fund , ATP , also of Denmark ,
has said that it will not accept the offer , the
five private equity investment firms that had obtained board approval
for the deal in November face the prospect of returning
to negotiations .
The outcome is expected to be closely watched by deal-makers in
Europe and the United States .
Private equity companies are under
pressure to spend the huge pools of capital they have
raised , and have found themselves edged out by corporate buyers
in some recent transactions .
They have looked for increasingly larger
prey , and the acquisition of TDC was considered a bellwether
deal because of its size and the number of private
investment firms involved .
ATP said Monday that it did not consider the cash offer
of 382 Danish kroner ( $ 61.88 ) a share " sufficiently attractive " compared
with TDC 's possible value if it remained a publicly listed
company and began making changes like selling off noncore assets .
It added that not completing the deal might produce uncertainty
over TDC 's share price , yet said that it was focused
on "long-term value creation . "
The prospective buyers -- the Blackstone Group , Apax Partners , Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts , Permira Advisers and Providence Equity Partners -- have until
Thursday to persuade a required 90 percent of TDC shareholders
to sign on to the deal .
ATP owns 5.5 percent ;
attaining the takeover threshold without the pension fund 's support seems
unlikely .
Several executives involved in the process said that the private equity
groups would sit down with ATP managers to try to
change their minds .
New negotiations could involve a higher offer to ATP for its
stake than for those of other investors , or even letting
it buy into the private equity deal .
It was unclear
how other investors might react to any special arrangements for
ATP.
The private investment firms may also try to extend
the Thursday deadline .
The private consortium said it remained " confident that all the conditions
to successful completion of the tender offer can be met "
by Thursday .
In a separate statement , TDC 's board said it continued to recommend
the deal to stockholders , and urged them to tender their
shares .
In trading in Copenhagen on Monday , TDC shares fell 2.1 percent .
If the deal falls apart , the stock price could drop
further because the takeover offer is 39 percent higher than
TDC 's share price the day before the company said it
had received a buyout approach .
