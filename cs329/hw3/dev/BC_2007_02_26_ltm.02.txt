Say it ai n't so .
The restaurant opened up in downtown Columbus back in 1969 .
The company says there are poor sales there .
But I have -- you have to ask , Ali Velshi , at 25 minutes past the hour , what would Dave say where he here ?
Wendy 's -- first , Dave opened this restaurant , named it after his daughter Melinda Lou .
I paused , too .
Her nickname was Wendy .
Oh , OK .
And Wendy 's says that Dave would have supported this decision , which as a journalist , it 's a little hard to confirm , but the issue is this has no drive-through , it 's got limited parking .
It needed improvements .
And apparently , they decided it was n't worth putting that all into this place .
So I sort of thought I would check out where the first McDonald 's and Burger King were .
McDonald 's , you know , that 's a tricky one , because it was sort of a copy of someone else 's restaurant .
Started in California , but then moved ...
Right .
So the first -- the first McDonald 's that was founded by Ray Crock was in Des Plaines , Illinois .
It opened in 1955 .
It 's now a McDonald 's museum .
But if you want a burger , you can go across the road for one .
And Burger King was started outside of Miami , suburban Miami is the first one there .
All right .
Is it still there ?
It 's called Insta Burger King .
I 'm having trouble finding out whether it was still there .
But this is definitely a story that I could go jump into with both feet .
Yes , you could .
VELSH
I have been talking about burgers a lot this morning .
For a month , really , yes .
Yes .
You were only going to run off the set and go have fast food .
I 'm done for a while .
I think I might just go eat .
Thank you , Ali .
All right .
Thanks , Ali .
The top stories of the morning are coming up next .
You 're going to be wheeling your luggage through snow and slush this morning .
There are lots of floods canceled .
We 'll tell you where this morning .
Plus , a genuine war hero took more than 70 friends to safety .
You 'll meet him and see footage of the actual battle straight ahead on AMERICAN MORNING.
The most news in the morning is right here on CNN.
CNN 's Alan Chernoff has more on the big storm .
He joins us live now from Kennedy Airport in New York City .
Alan , we sure hope there are n't going to be any passengers turned hostages today .
No, JetBlue is actually taking a preemptive strike .
JetBlue canceled 68 flights actually in and out of JFK this morning .
Not all of their flights , though .
They are flying to Aruba , but they 're not flying to Austin .
They 're flying to Nassau , but not Nashville .
You got the idea .
Get those vacation travelers to those warm spots .
Do n't worry about the business travelers .
We have other cancellations as well .
Delta Airlines , 27 departing flights canceled .
American , seven departures canceled , including San Francisco and London .
But the bulk of the flights this morning from JFK are taking off .
Some delays .
