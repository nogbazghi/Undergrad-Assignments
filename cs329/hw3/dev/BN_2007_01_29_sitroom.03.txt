Listen to what Tony Snow said in the White House briefing room earlier today .
What does the president think of the march on Washington ?
I think he ( ph ) thought a lot about it .
You know , I mean , it 's nice to see Jane Fonda in front of a camera again .
Snow , added , by the way , that it 's perfectly appropriate for Americans to protest the war if they so chose to do so .
Still ahead tonight , how low will they go ?
President Bush 's already sagging poll numbers take a turn for the worse .
We 're going to tell you where the president 's job approval rating is right now and what it means .
And could a former president become the First Man ?
To be the First Man ? Get it ?
We 'll examine the possible scenario if Hillary Clinton becomes the next president .
We 'll be right back .
Tonight , forces of political gravity are tugging harder than ever on President Bush and his poll numbers , despite his State of the Union Address last week .
Take a look at this .
Five surveys taken in mid-January show the president 's job approval rating ranging from 28 percent to 35 percent .
The 28 percent figure in a new CBS News poll is the lowest approval rating ever for Mr. Bush .
Averaging all of the numbers together in all of these polls , the president gets a 32 percent approval rating .
Our Bill Schneider is looking at all these numbers .
The numbers clearly do not bode well for the president during the start of these final two years in office , Bill .
No, they do n't .
A job rating , Wolf , is a measure of the president 's clout .
More than 70 percent of Americans do not think President Bush will have the clout to get what he wants done over the next two years .
When members of the president 's own party begin to distance themselves , as some Republicans are now doing over the troop build-up in Iraq , you know he 's in trouble .
Voters elected a Democratic Congress to challenge him , and 64 percent told the " Newsweek " poll that since the Iraq war began , they do not think Congress has been assertive enough in challenging the administration on the war .
Wolf , only four presidents since World War II have seen their job ratings drop below 30 percent .
One was Harry Truman .
He chose not to run for reelection .
Richard Nixon was forced to resign .
Jimmy Carter was fired after one term , and so was Bush 's own father in 1992 .
When you 're this low , the voters consider your presidency over .
Is that the way they feel about President Bush ?
Apparently .
Fifty-eight percent in the " Newsweek " poll said they personally wished George W. Bush ' presidency were over -- Wolf .
Those are pretty horrible numbers .
So how does it play out ?
Because politicians always look at these poll numbers , even though they insist they do n't -- they ignore the polls , they do n't pay attention to the polls .
We know they really do .
How does it play out in the 2008 presidential race if these numbers stay firm ?
