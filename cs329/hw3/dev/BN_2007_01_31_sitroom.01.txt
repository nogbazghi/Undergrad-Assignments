Commissioner , thank you .
I think we are all relieved that the devices found so far have proven to be hoax devices .
We are very gratified by the prompt and professional response of all of law enforcement -- the commissioner and the mayor and his team , the transit police from the T , the state police , working cooperatively with the ATF.
And we 're very , very gratified that the response has been as prompt , as professional and as cooperative as it has been .
The investigation continues .
There is more information to be developed .
But I think we feel at this point that there is not a reason for anyone to panic , but there are reasons for us to be vigilant .
And , as I say , we are relieved and pleased that none of the devices have so far been found to pose a threat to public safety .
And I want to commend all of the leaders and members of law enforcement represented here with me and the lieutenant governor and Secretary Burke for the cooperation shown in pursuing today 's events .
Mr.
Mayor ?
Thank you .
Thank you , Governor .
Early this morning , I received a call from Commissioner Davis of a suspicious bomb in Sullivan Square in Cambridge .
And from that point until right now , the Boston Police , the state police , the ATF and the BRIC , which is the Boston Regional Investigative Service , have been working together investigating all calls that they 've got about suspicious bombs being in Boston and in Somerville .
I just want to say that every one of those so far has been investigated , either the Boston police and the federal and state folks are working on those investigations .
I just want to say to the public , you know , public safety officials , both the federal , state and city side , are all working together .
Like the governor says , at no time anyone should panic .
We believe we have the situation in hand and that to go about your business .
And Commissioner Davis said , we will have additional officers at different locations during the transit time this evening , as people make their way home , just to give the sense that we are out there and doing our jobs .
And it 's just about all of us .
And the individuals who might have placed these bombs , or these packages , I should say , should be warned that this is a heavy penalty .
It 's imprisonment , two to five years for each one of them .
So , it 's not -- we 're not playing around .
This is about keeping the city on edge .
It 's about public safety .
When it comes to public safety , we 're throwing everything at it .
Mr.
Mayor , we 're hearing that Turner Broadcasting is saying ...
Well , Joe ( ph ) , I 'm not finished yet .
( OFF-MIKE ) apologize .
We thought you were finished , Mr. Mayor .
You 're last in questions now .
I just want to say that we 're staying -- we will stay focused .
The unified command center will stay open as long as we deem necessary .
And I just want to finish up and say thanks for everyone working together .
This is when public safety really rises to the occasion , because public safety , both in the federal , state , and seaside , have been doing their jobs since early in the morning , this morning , and they will continue the rest of the day .
