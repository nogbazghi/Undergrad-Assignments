I have a dog and a cat , both are short hairs and although they are house trained they still leave messes .
I purchased the Dyson ( animal ) based on reviews I had read and well .... I was a sucker for they could n't have been more wrong .
I read that it was the top of the line in removing animal hair , the filtration system is unlike all the others and although it 's expensive , you get what you pay for..yadda , yadda , yadda .
Save yourself and do n't believe the hype !
After trying the Hoover , Bissell and Dyson over a span of 8 years , the Dyson was the most disappointing .
If you can find a Dyson for $ 20.00 or less then I would say it was worth it ...anything more and you 're paying a lot to live in filth .
The Dyson worked for me for about 1 month , after that it broke repeatedly .
Sure you have the warranty , but it does n't help when you have to take the time to send it in every other month .
The problem with all these new "bag less " vacuums is that it never really holds the dirt in and there are so many parts to it they break easily .
If I can help anyone looking for a new vacuum , I would recommend checking out the brands that use bags .
Sure it 's annoying to change the bags but at least you know that after you vacuum the dirt up it is n't going to go back into the air because the filtration system is sealing it inside a bag .
Plus because bag vacuums tend to be older brands they do n't have hundreds of small parts for marketing or visual wow factors so they do n't break as often .
Also , regardless of what a salesman may say , bags are not expensive .
You can get a 4-8 pack of vacuum bags regardless of the brand for $ 10-20 dollars .
You 'll really only need up to 8 bags a year if not less depending on how big your vacuuming area is .
I hope this review helps .
BITE ME DYSON !
