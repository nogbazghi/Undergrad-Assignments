What kind of effect did Reagan have when he came to visit ?
Is this -- do you think this is more of a P.R. move , or does this really affect things economically , trading wise , investor wise ?
I mean , what type of effect do you think this has truly outside of a P.R. move ?
President Reagan was here in 1985 during trading hours .
Kyra , he actually came again in '92 with Mikhail Gorbachev , but he came to talk about his economic policy .
And he 's absolutely beloved on Wall Street , as you can imagine .
And it 's almost stating the obvious that -- that this is his audience .
This is a conservative crowd .
This is the kind of community where less government intervention is something that is applauded .
Lower taxes , that 's something that investors like .
More trade policies , that 's something investors like .
They want to see it translate to the bottom line .
And , Kyra ...
Are you close to him , Susan ?
Is he coming toward you ?
I do n't see him yet , but I see a lot of Secret Service people , and I 'm edging in , and I have my tiny wireless microphone , and I 'm going to extend it if I see him .
Absolutely .
As he makes -- and I 'll try to monitor this other shot that we have , Susan .
If I can see that he 's making his way toward you , getting closer toward you , we 're expecting you to stick that mic out .
You never know what he might say to you .
I am definitely going to do it .
And I 'm glad that I have two athletic brothers that trained me well for reporting from the floor of the stock exchange , Kyra .
That is for sure .
You 're going to do a body block for us to get yourself in there , and get a word with the president ?
You know , it 's interesting .
This is a very busy day , as I mentioned .
We have the Federal Reserve decision on interest rates .
We have a lot of corporations reporting their earnings today , like Boeing , for instance , very nice earnings .
And the GDP -- it was a logical place for the president to come .
The GDP , which is broadest measure of the economy , Kyra , came in much better than expected .
The president really has some evidence to say that the U.S. economy is in good shape .
I ca n't see him just yet , but I think he is close by , Kyra .
I think he is making his way toward you , because I recognize some of the monitors and the lead Secret Service guy that 's right in front of him is -- he 's got a kind of a light blue tie .
You 'll see about ...
Actually ...
Can you see him ?
I see -- I see the -- yes , I do see him .
I see his gray head .
I 'm gutting pushed back , but I 'm ...
What do you want to know from the president , Susan ?
I would like to know what he thinks he can achieve with the majority -- with the Congress he can no longer count on to support him in terms of some of the policies he 's proposing .
