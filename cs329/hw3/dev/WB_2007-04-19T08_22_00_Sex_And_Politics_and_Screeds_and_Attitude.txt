Roger Hardy ( BBC News ) notes of yesterday , " This was supposed to be a day when the Iraqi government could show it was making tangible progress towards the eventual withdrawal of foreign forces . "
Hardy 's referring to the handoff of the Maysan province to Iraqi control .
As noted yesterday , the transfer was supposed to be a brilliant photo-op , puppet of the occupation Nouri al-Maliki had a speech all prepared but ended up being a no-show when the latest wave of Operation Happy Talk splashed and crashed against reality .
Mowaffaq al-Rubaie , Iraq 's National Security Adviser , ended up reading al-Maliki 's speech .
The empty words are all the more empty because , quoting Patrick Cockburn , " the transfer of political or security control by the US and Britain to Iraqi authorities has always been deceptive .
Iraqis believe , with some reason , that real control remains in the hands of the occuyping forces .
Earlier in the year , British forces blew up a police headquarters in Basra and US helicopter-borne troops tried to kidnap two senior Iranian officials visiting Jalal Talabani , the Iraqi president . "
If you use the links or read any of the coverage , you may note something missing -- what tends to always go missing : Iraqi women 's voices .
Though many reports mention that women ( and children ) were among the victims , Iraqi women 's voices are abesent from the reporting .
Did you know that on one day in November , a Baghdad morgue housed 150 female corpses ?
( They had gathered over a ten day period with no one claiming them . )
Ms. readers will know that .
In the spring 2007 issue of Ms .
( in stores on April 24th ) , Bay Fang contributes " The Talibanization of Iraq " ( pages 46 through 51 ) which takes a look at women 's lives in Iraq since the start of the illegal war , noting the destruction of basic rights and much more .
Yanar Mohammed ( Organization for Women 's Freedom in Iraq ) tells Fang of being able to "meet with groups of 200 or 300 women at factories or the railway station " in the early years of the illegal war ; " But this year is completely different .
A woman ca n't even walk two to three blocks safely , much less [come to ] a meeting . "
Bay Fang addresses the MADRE report ( which may make Ms. one of the first national periodicals to do so -- on MADRE 's report click here to read in full in PDF format or in HTML ) , addresses the issue of " OH THERE ARE WOMEN IN THE PARLIAMENT ! " by noting " During the January 2005 elections for the National Assembly , political parties were required to field electoral slates on which every third candidate was a woman , and as a result women captured 31 percent of the seats .
But nearly half of the elected women parliamentarians ran on the list of the Shiite alliance , and they have had to toe the conservative line of their party .
Some of the women parliamentarians could be forces for moderation and progress -- such as Mayson al-Damluji , a former undersecretary of culture who has urged the prime minister to honor his pledge to improve women 's rights -- but the dangerous political environment of targeted assassinations has prevented them from being very outspoken . "
Again , the latest issue of Ms. magazine ( Spring 2007 ) goes on sale April 24th .
And though Fang 's article is n't available currently online , Martha Mendoza 's " Between a Woman and her Doctor " went up yesterday .
