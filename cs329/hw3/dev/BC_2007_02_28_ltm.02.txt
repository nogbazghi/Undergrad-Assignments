But , you know , that 's kind of the American way .
We always want to be happy and healthy and perfect and not have these difficulties in our life .
And people are always searching for that .
I thought it was interesting that there was a statistic after 9/11 .
The sales of self-help books went down drastically and stayed down for a period .
Really ?
I thought you were going to say up .
No.
Is n't that interesting ?
Yes .
And I think maybe it suggests something about when we 're really in times of tragedy , when we 're in life-and-death situations of the kind of basic things in life ... S. O'BRIE
Turn to organized religion .
Well , no , but people do n't need as much this idea of , oh , I have to perfect myself and I have to improve myself and get things for myself .
It becomes about community and it becomes about the really the sort of life-and-death matters , rather than just self perfection and individual search .
I truly believe that I -- that Powerball can come to me .
What is it now , $ 289 -- Powerball can come to me .
I believe that Powerball can come to me .
Well , it 's a good thing to talk about .
The stock market is down , so maybe people need to start practicing that .
You know , could be .
Could be .

You 've got to play to win -- to know the secret .
All morning we 've been looking at the HPV.
That 's the human papillomavirus , what it is and who gets it .
But there is a big business side to all of this .
It involves the HPV vaccine and the pharmaceutical giant pushing it .
Ali Velshi joining us from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with a closer look at Merck , the maker of that vaccine , Gardasil -- Ali .
Hey , Miles .
Merck really needed Gardasil , because it had been reeling from the whole Vioxx scandal and some big drugs that were coming off of their patent protection .
So Merck really , really pushed it , but then this controversy caused the company to pull back a bit .
Each year in the U.S. , thousands of women learn they have cervical cancer .
I could be one less .
It sounds like the easiest sell in history , a vaccine against cancer .
Merck expected to earn more than $ 3 billion a year from Gardasil by the end of the decade .
At least that was the goal .
Our goal is cervical cancer prevention , and we do n't want to be a distraction to that goal .
And our perception is that we are a distraction to that goal .
The Gardasil distraction , a controversial lobbying effort to make the vaccine mandatory for preteen girls in 20 states .
But Merck 's problems do n't end there .
Remember Vioxx ?
Merck pulled the drug in 2004 , instantly wiping out $ 2.5 billion a year in sales and a third of the stock 's value .
Raymond Gilmartin , Merck 's CEO at the time , resigned a few months later .
And between victories and losses in the Vioxx cases , Merck is facing other challenges .
