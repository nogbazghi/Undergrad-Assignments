Mm , that 's true .
That is true .
Mm , I do n't know .
Um , also I 'm trying to , like , gauge how much actual -- how much , ah , of the country itself was anti Saddam .
Yeah .
That 's -- that 's a hard guess , um , and --
A very hard guess .
-- I -- I think i- if anything these are where the tribal differences are coming in because --
Right .
-- it really seemed to be his power base was limited to his tribe .
Okay .
And as the farther out you get from that , you know , the more hostile --
Right .
-- you got .
I mean , the- there --
Obviously Kurds and Sunnis and not going to be ...
Yeah .
I mean , the real big question is whether or not , you know , to get a good stable regime in the area we really should try and keep it as Iraq or , you know , be willing to break it up into smaller nations .
Right .
Um , you know .
I per- I personally would love to see a Kurdistan , but that would really tick off a lot of the neighboring nations .
Kurdistan , okay .
Um , wait , are the Kurds in the north and the Sunnis in the south or vice ?
The Kurds are in the north , the Sunnis are in the south --
Right .
-- the Shiites sort of , I guess , have that middle band .
Okay .
Hm , interesting .
Um , let me see , what else do I have to say on the subject ?
Um , so you do think , ah , there is a very good possibility for a peaceful regime to be set up , just it 's gonna take a while ?
Yeah .
I mean , like anything it 's gonna take time because , you know , you ca n't just have a democratic regime overnight .
You need to --
-- sort of build up the infrastructure of democracy .
You have to be able to -- you know , they have to get used to having a completely free press , which is going to be something completely new for the region .
Right .
Um , they have to get used to , you know , political dissent .
They have to get used to a lot of things .
And , you know --
-- if that happens ...
Also another thing is when , ah , when you kind of go into another country and try to set stuff up , h - like , what model or what specific type of democracy is going to be --
-- implemented there ?
Like who decides all that ?
Like is it , like , ah , gonna be kinda --
' Cause I feel -- like , there was a guy speaking , I think he was -- he was educated here , I think MIT if I 'm correct , I 'm not even sure .
And , um , he had left Iraq way back when and just , ah , went back and , um , I feel like I do n't know if him and his group of people are going to be involved with , like , Americans to try to ...
