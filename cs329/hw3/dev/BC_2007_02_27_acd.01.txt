So , the bottom line is , these peace deals are -- seem to have empowered al Qaeda , empowered the Taliban ?
I would say it has given them a free hand .
I mean , it was successful in -- in one measure , in that attacks against the Pakistani military went down dramatically after the signing of the peace deal .
But the question is at what cost .
Well , I think we know that the cost is pretty high for U.S. and NATO troops on the other side , right ?
Yes .
To use a medical analogy , it is like quitting a course of antibiotics too soon .
You just leave a reservoir of infection , even stronger , to come back after you .
The Taliban in their black turbans , gun- toting mullahs in camouflage , foreign jihadis training , launching deadly attacks , graphic evidence that al Qaeda and their allies in the Taliban have largely survived the West 's furious assaults , and that what did n't kill them has only made them stronger .
Hmm .
So , what can be done to address this Taliban and al Qaeda resurgence ?
Is it just a matter of more troops , more money ?
Well , the Bush administration has asked for $ 10.8 billion for reconstruction , to build up the Afghan police , to build up the Afghan army , to -- more aid , also for more troops .
The British are putting in more troops .
I think that is all good .
But I think we also , collectively , Afghanistan , Pakistan , the United States and NATO has to try and sort out the tribal areas , try and deal with these militants .
It is a question of collective security for all the countries involved .
And we need to be creative .
Peter Bergen , appreciate it .
Joining me now is the Pakistani ambassador to the U.S. , Mahmud Durrani .
Mr.
Ambassador , thanks for being with us .
You heard the piece , Peter Bergen 's reporting .
This peace deal that your government with -- with tribal elders , militants in Waziristan , Pakistan said it was a positive step to fighting terror .
Since then , U.S. officials are saying attacks along the Pakistan- Afghan border have gone up some 300 percent .
In your opinion , has this deal strengthened the Taliban and al Qaeda in Pakistan ?
I think you somehow manage to keep one eye shut and one eye open .
You do n't seem to realize what is happening in Afghanistan .
Taliban are in Afghanistan .
They 're carrying out raids every day .
There is the suicide bomb .
They captured two district headquarters .
And everybody is crying about north Waziristan .
North Waziristan is a small area .
And I do not think that the deal that we signed with them has helped the extremists and the terrorists , not at all .
The unit I was with , the 10th Mountain Division , who were right along the border -- I was with them back in September -- going on patrol basically along the border , they told me point blank , they see people crossing that border all the time , attacking , and then running back across into Pakistan .
Do you believe that that happens ?
I believe that a lot of people cross the border .
In fact , I am sure you know , on a daily basis , about 200,000 people cross the Pakistan-Afghan border .
