I have always had a weakness for Dada , and within this quixotic movement a special liking for Schwitters .
So I visited the Dada-exposition in the Paris Centre Pompidou last year , and there bought both the Dickerman catalogue of the American exposition , and the ( French language ) catalogue of the Centre Pompidou itself , which differ in many ways .
The exposition was wonderful by the way , and one of the best I ' ve seen in many years .
Thinking that a morning would be enough to see what I wanted to see , I changed my mind , decided to take dinner in the Pompidou , and stayed for the rest of the day .
The immense amount of material was stunning .
And the same thing really goes for both impressive catalogues .
The American ( Dickerman ) version ( 520 pages ) follows Dada by way of the cities where Dada developed , and does so in a more or less chronological fashion .
Essays are excellent , photomaterial looks great .
It is the sort of catalogue you would expect from an exposition like this .
The European catalogue , more than thousand pages , printed on very thin paper , treats subjects , artists , and everything else connected with Dada according to alfabet .
It seems to me that the catalogue has just about everything that could be seen at the exposition , with exception of the films of course .
Although I felt a bit silly after buying both catalogues ( spending some 100 euros ) , I was in the end very glad that I did .
Everybody who buys catalogues now and then , know how disappointing these sometimes are .
Well , these are n't .
They are both superb , knowledgeable .
And the people who made them have done a terrific job .
In the end you wind up thinking : Hey , these guys ( and girls ) must have loved Dada as much as I do .
