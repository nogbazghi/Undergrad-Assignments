" Saturday Night Live " fans looking to watch classic skits from the
show may not have to depend on reruns and DVD
compilations for long .
Apple is set to announce Tuesday that it will sell a
limited number of archived " Saturday Night " skits through its iTunes
Music Store for $ 1.99 each , for viewing on video iPods
or personal computers .
The offering is the latest expansion of Apple 's iTunes video library ,
which includes content from television networks including NBC and ABC .
The Sci Fi Channel , Disney and USA Network have also struck
deals with Apple to sell their television content , typically making
shows available for purchase one day after they are broadcast .
But the only " Saturday Night " content available on iTunes was " Lazy
Sunday , " a spoof music video that had its debut on
the Dec. 17 episode .
The video , which mockingly chronicled a
mundane Sunday afternoon through the rapper personas of the cast
members Chris Parnell and Andy Samberg , was made available free
to iTunes subscribers and quickly became an Internet sensation .
NBC first announced a deal with Apple on Dec. 6 to
sell its own content on iTunes after ABC experienced success
selling shows like " Lost " and " Desperate Housewives . "
Under NBC 's arrangement with Apple , iTunes users can purchase commercial-free episodes
of new shows like " The Office , " and " Surface , " as well
as classics like the original " Dragnet " and " Alfred Hitchcock Presents . "
An Apple spokesman said the company sold more than 3
million video downloads in October and November .
