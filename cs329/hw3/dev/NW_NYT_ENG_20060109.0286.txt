added , "only a small percentage of people are going to
be able to finance meaningful pensions .
What happens then to
the rest ? "
As a result of such doubts , attacking the pension system and
especially the perceived excesses of the funds has become a
surefire source of votes .
One of the big winners in
the first round of the election last month , for example ,
was Guido Girardi , a senator-elect and Bachelet supporter who has
taken upon himself the role of scourge of the private
management funds .
" I am going to do away with these thieves in jackets
and ties , " Girardi vowed .
" We are going to defend the
citizenry from these funds that rob people of their pensions . "

But even advocates of an untrammeled free market , like Pinera , the
conservative candidate , are jumping in with criticisms , to the surprise
of some here .
Pinera is the brother of Jose Pinera ,
the former labor minister who imposed the personal account system
during the Pinochet dictatorship .
In addition , Sebastian Pinera is backed
by the large business groups that control the pension funds
and have benefited from the expansion of investment capital the
funds have provided .
" Chile 's social security system requires deep reforms in all sectors , because
half of Chileans have no pension coverage , and of those
who do , 40 percent are going to find it hard
to reach the minimum level , " Pinera said in a televised
debate with Bachelet on Wednesday .
" This has to be confronted
now , and we agree with Michelle Bachelet and will , I
hope , join forces behind this large undertaking . "
One of the changes Pinera has proposed is a guaranteed pension
for housewives , which the Bachelet camp dismisses as populist posturing
that will add to government expenditures .
He also favors financial
incentives to the poor , such as matching government contributions , to
encourage them to participate in the system ; more bargaining power
for consumers and increased competition among the funds to force
them to bring down their fees .
" We do n't want to dismantle the system , we just want to
improve it , " said Felipe Larrain , Pinera 's chief economic adviser .
But
"pensions are very low , " he acknowledged , and reform is " not
just an issue of fixing the pension fund management system ,
because there are also people who cannot get an adequate
pension " based on the contributions they are making .
Jose Pinera , who is co-chairman of the conservative Cato Institute 's Project
on Social Security Choice , based in Washington , did not respond
to e-mail requests for an interview to discuss the changes
being proposed here .
But his Web site reprinted a recent
article in the conservative daily El Mercurio here that criticizes
the changes proposed by both candidates as "demagoguery . "

Officials in the Bachelet campaign said Bachelet had already decided to
appoint a commission to examine the social security system and
recommend changes if she is elected .
They predicted that legislation
to overhaul the system would be presented to Congress within
six months of her taking office in March .
" It 's a big reform , not just patching a few things up , "
