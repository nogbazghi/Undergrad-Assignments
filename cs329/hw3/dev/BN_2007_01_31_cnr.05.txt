Hi there , Don .
Stuart Bowen Jr. , special inspector-general for Iraq reconstruction , billed 2006 as a year of transition .
But this quarterly report that he released today really tells a very different story .
In fact , one of the most glaring examples of waste in the report is perhaps something that deals with DynCorp .
This is a company that on its Web site says that it is a private corporation that supports government and military operations .
So what this report says is that the Department of State paid DynCorp $ 43.8 million for a residential camp for police training personnel .
Well , it turns out that this camp was never even used .
And also , the office of the inspector-general says about $ 4 million of that was spent by Iraq 's Ministry of the Interior on 20 VIP trailers , also an Olympic-size swimming pool , and that these were projects that were not authorized by the Department of State as they should have been .
Now , furthermore , this report says that about $ 36 million paid by the Department of State to DynCorp was spent on weapons and equipment .
Equipment like armored vehicles , body armor and all of that is unaccounted for .
This report says there was not a proper paper trail in that case .
And a spokesman for the State Department says taxpayer money should be spent responsibly .
They 're going to take corrective action but would n't specify , Don , exactly what corrective action they are taking .
Brianna Keilar , thanks , as always .
Let 's get straight to the newsroom .
Fredricka Whitfield working a story out of Boston -- Fred .
Right .
Well , you know that hours ago a suspicious package was found in the Boston area in Charlestown , near a transit area .
And that suspicious package was detonated .
And after looking closer at it , after the detonation , police noticed that it did have an electronic circuit board and some components that were consistent with an improvised explosive device , but they do n't believe it was a threatening device , just that it had some of the components .
And now hours after detonating it , now police have located four other suspicious packages dispersed in different areas around the Boston area .
They continue to look closer at these items before making the next step , which would be detonating them , or perhaps even bringing in some kind of robotic apparatus .
You are looking at live pictures right now of the Longfellow Bridge , which is apparently where one of the investigations is under way right now .
Earlier , you note from that suspicious package that it did back up transit traffic .
And eventually things resumed to some normalcy .
But now police in the Boston area have this on their hands as they look into four other suspicious packages dispersed in various locations .
When we get those specific locations we 'll be able to bring that to you and any other information that we get -- Kyra .
All right , Fred .
Appreciate it .
We 'll stay in touch .
A deadly propane blast in West Virginia .
