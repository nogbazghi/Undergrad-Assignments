The Wicks work great when you first get them .
Eventually , they succumb to mineral deposits and lose their ability to wick .
I manage to get 4-6 weeks out of one set .
I wish that they lasted longer or that there was a solvent you could use to dissolve the minerals ( hot water works a little ) .
Until that happens , I 'll be buying refills on a regular basis .
I suppose that it beats catching lots of colds or having dry skin all the time .
