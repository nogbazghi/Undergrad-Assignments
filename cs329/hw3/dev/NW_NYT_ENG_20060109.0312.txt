As California braces for its second execution in
less than two months , a legislative committee today will consider
a bill to place a three-year moratorium on the death
penalty .
The fate of Assembly Bill 1121 will not be decided soon
enough to affect Clarence Ray Allen , 75 , the mastermind of
a triple murder who is scheduled to die Jan 17 ,
but the bill potentially could affect dozens of other death
row inmates .
AB 1121 's proposed moratorium comes at a time of substantial public
debate over the death penalty , prompted in part by last
month 's execution of Stanley " Tookie " Williams , 51 , a quadruple murderer
and founder of the Crips street gang who later urged
abandonment of gang violence .
Assembly Democrats Paul Koretz of West Hollywood and Sally Lieber of
Mountain View are joint authors of the measure , which faces
its first legislative hurdle today before the Assembly Public Safety
Committee .
Koretz and Lieber said a three-year moratorium would provide time for
the state to study whether the death penalty is being
implemented fairly and whether additional safeguards are needed .
A newly created panel , the California Commission on the Fair Administration
of Justice , is charged with completing such a study and
making recommendations to the Legislature by Dec. 31 , 2007 .
San Quentin 's death row currently contains nearly 650 convicted criminals , including
more than 20 who are in the final stages of
appeal before an execution date is set .
" With the flurry of executions facing us , there 's a chance that
we could possibly execute an innocent person , " Koretz said .
" It only makes common sense that if you 're studying things that
go wrong with the death penalty , you do n't keep executing
people while you 're doing that study . "
But opponents of AB 1121 claim it represents a first step
toward banning the death penalty .
" This is nothing more than trying to pull the rug out
from underneath the justice system , " said Assemblyman Jay La Suer ,
R-La Mesa .
Assemblyman Todd Spitzer , R-Orange , ripped AB 1121 as the "be kind
to cop killers act . "
Marc Klaas , a crime-victims advocate whose 12-year-old daughter , Polly , was kidnapped
and murdered in 1993 , blasted AB 1121 as an affront
to families devastated by violent crime .
" Myself and hundreds of other individuals who are waiting for justice
to be carried out will be sorely disappointed and again
victimized by a system that seems to pay more attention
to those who commit crimes than those who suffer from
crimes , " Klaas said .
Supporters of AB 1121 counter that the criminal justice system sometimes
convicts the wrong person .
More than 120 people have been released from death rows nationwide
since 1973 , according to an analysis of AB 1121 by
the Assembly Public Safety Committee .
Five convicts have been released from California 's death row since 1988
after substantive questions emerged about their convictions and charges later
were dropped or they were acquitted in retrial , the analysis
said .
Attorney General Bill Lockyer , a Democrat , opposes AB 1121 .
" No innocent person in this state has ever come close to
being executed , " said Nathan Barankin , Lockyer 's spokesman .

Sacramento District Attorney Jan Scully said numerous checks and balances --
from prosecutorial charging decisions to jury findings and lengthy appeals
-- are built into the criminal justice system to protect
defendants ' rights .
Since 1992 , 12 California death row inmates have been executed in
this state , and one in Missouri .
Their average stay on
death row was 17 years , state records show .
" We already have a de facto moratorium in California -- and
it 's a heckuva lot longer than three years , " Scully said
of multiple appeals .
" In some cases , it takes a lifetime . "
Lieber said the new death penalty commission should look at things
like the disproportionate number of African Americans on death row ,
35 percent , and whether laws governing special circumstances in capital
cases are applied fairly .
" Let 's make sure that people are getting executed because of the
crime , not because of who the victim was or where
the crime was committed , " said Assemblyman Mark Leno , D-San Francisco ,
who chairs the public safety committee .
Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Assembly Speaker Fabian NÃºÃ±ez have taken no
position on AB 1121 .
Senate President Pro Tem Don Perata
said he supports it , but does not expect it to
pass the Legislature in this election year .
