As a federal corruption investigation edges closer to embattled
Rep.
Tom DeLay , two liberal groups plan to launch a
TV advertisement this week in his suburban Houston district emphasizing
the lawmaker 's ethics controversies .
The TV spot will point out connections between the Sugar Land
Republican and former lobbyist Jack Abramoff , who pleaded guilty to
corruption charges last week in a Justice Department investigation of
his dealings on Capitol Hill .
DeLay , who denies wrongdoing , had several political ties with Abramoff .
Also ,
former DeLay press secretary Michael Scanlon has pleaded guilty to
conspiring with Abramoff to bilk Indian tribes of millions of
dollars in fees .
The DeLay ad , along with one to be aired in the
Ohio district of GOP Rep. Bob Ney , who has been
implicated in Abramoff 's schemes , is part of an effort to
build support for cleaning up Congress , said Toby Chaudhuri , spokesman
for the Campaign for America 's Future .
His group , which receives significant funding from labor unions , and a
watchdog group , the Public Campaign Action Fund , are sponsoring the
ads and have run others attacking DeLay .
They are expected
to announce today an effort to pressure Congress to pass
lobbying and campaign finance reforms this year .
" Tom DeLay , Bob Ney and other powerful congressmen are caught in
the middle of the worst corruption scandal to hit Washington
since Watergate , " Chaudhuri said .
Ney also denies breaking the law .
A DeLay spokeswoman questioned the motives and connections of the organizations .
The Campaign for America 's Future " consistently attack( s ) conservative leaders like President
Bush and now they 're getting involved in a district they
probably could n't point to on a map , " DeLay spokeswoman Shannon
Flaherty said .
" While I do n't know what the ad looks
like , I can guess it will in no way depict
the labor unions they 're affiliated with or what they really
support -- higher taxes , more government control , and the laughable
leadership of Nancy Pelosi and Nick Lampson . "
Pelosi , of California , leads Democrats in the House .
Former Congressman Lampson
is unopposed for the Democratic nomination for DeLay 's 22nd Congressional
District seat in the November election .
Entangled in criminal investigations of his political activities in Texas and
Washington , DeLay on Saturday relinquished his claim to the job
of House majority leader , from which he stepped down temporarily
in September after he was indicted in Travis County on
money laundering and conspiracy charges relating to campaign finance .
Voters in DeLay 's district surely are aware of his troubles , said
Southern Methodist University political scientist Cal Jillson , but the television
ads could serve to "energize ( DeLay 's ) opponents and discourage and
dismay his supporters . "
Austin political consultant Bill Miller , who often advises Republicans , said DeLay 's
political situation has worsened and recommended that he consider running
ads of his own soon .
" He needs to spend money if he wants to begin to
change things for the better for himself right now , unless
and until events change , " Miller said .
Flaherty said the campaign will keep its strategy private .
DeLay faces a March primary against three GOP candidates .
Former GOP
Rep.
Steve Stockman has filed for a place on the
November ballot as an independent .
