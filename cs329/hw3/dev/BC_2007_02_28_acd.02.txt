OK .
The DNA -- we did n't conduct the DNA tests .
One of the five best Paleo-DNA labs in the world , Dr. Carney Matheson conducted the DNA test .
OK , let me jump in .
Simcha , just to respond to what you said .
The critics would also say that the reason scientists have sort of not paid attention to this tomb is because they disregarded this long ago .
Bu I want to bring in Sandra .
You heard some of what Simcha is saying .
Your response ?
Well , I think my response is , well , the implication is that people disregarded this on purpose .
I mean , obviously when they first -- when the Archaeologist Koner ( ph ) first excavated these ossuaries , he noted the names .
They are common names .
I 'm not going to address statistical analysis now .
But I might also add that in the 90s , I believe , they excavated tombs not far from there in North Talpiot , where they found similar names .
And in those tombs , the bones themselves , they found as many as three or four individuals in one ossuary .
What people are saying is , if this -- if you really feel strongly and confident in the results you got , why not submit it to a peer review scientific journal ?
I repeat again , I got no results .
I 'm a filmmaker .
I have a skill set .
It 's journalism .
I have two U.S. Emmys in investigative journalism .
What I did is I took the skills of investigative journalism and brought them to bear on the biblical archaeological story .
Now I am coming and telling the world in the book , in the film that 's going to air on Discovery Sunday night , here is the evidence , here 's the DNA evidence , here 's the statistics evidence .
Let 's not listen to archaeologists saying -- giving their opinions about statistics .
Let 's go to statisticians .
Let 's go to forensic archaeologists .
I followed the scientists and I recorded what they said , not what I say .
And now I am reporting it to the world .
And I hope this will be the beginning of the story , not the end of the story .
Scientists should weigh in .
Well , we 're going to leave there .
And they certainly are weighing in .
Simcha , we appreciate your perspective .
Sandra , as well .
Thank you very much , both of you .
Biblical mysteries to the exodus of Iraqi refugees .
They are leaving Iraq in droves and some may be heading to America .
Forced from their homes .
There were bullets brushing at home .
Someone was firing ( UNINTELLIGIBLE) .
Casualties of the war .
Iraqi refugees fleeing the frontlines .
They may also be coming to America .
But at what price ?
Among the 7,000 Iraqis we 're talking about here , it certainly is possible that a given person could be a terrorist .
Security risk for granting asylum ?
Ahead , on 360 .
All combat troops come home with memories that can be hard to come to grip with .
Some , though , bring back nightmares , searing experiences like ones faced by a unit back at their base .
They were on lunch break inside the perimeter .
They thought they were safe , but then a massive explosion .
