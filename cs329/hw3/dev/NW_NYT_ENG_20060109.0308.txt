Records showing how thoroughly the Internal Revenue Service audits big corporations
and the rich , and how much it discounts the additional
taxes assessed after audits , are being withheld from the public
despite a 1976 court order requiring their disclosure , according to
a legal motion filed last week in federal court in
Seattle .
For decades , the information was given at no charge to a
professor at Syracuse University , Susan B. Long , who made it
available on the Internet at trac.syr.edu , with tools for people
to conduct their own analyses .
Much of what the public knows about the efficiency , effectiveness and
evenhandedness of the revenue service and other big federal agencies
is based on the figures that Long collects and posts .
In May 2004 , the service told her that it would not
provide the information and ordered its statisticians to stop answering
her questions .
It also advised her that if it ever
did make the data public again , the information would cost
$ 12,000 a month to receive electronic copies .
Long , whose suit resulted in the court order in 1976 , when
she lived in Seattle , asked the federal court there to
enforce that order , which instructed that the data be turned
over without charge .
Eric M. Stahl of Davis Wright Tremaine
in Seattle , who is handling the case without charge , said
the earliest hearing date would be Jan .
27 .
The senior national spokesman for the tax agency , Frank Keith , wrote
to Long in June 2004 that he had lawyers examine
her assertion that the agency was required to provide the
data .
After extensive research , Keith wrote , the lawyers concluded that
no court order existed and that "accordingly , the IRS is
not in violation of any standing injunctions . "
Long responded by sending Keith a copy of the order .
Keith
said no one now at the agency was aware of
it .
" We thought we were providing this information voluntarily , " he said .
The agency has no plans to release the information , Keith said
Friday .
David Burnham , co-director with Long of the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse ,
which collects raw government data , said the withheld information made
it impossible to evaluate the intensity of audits .
" It is simply impossible to evaluate the IRS without this data , "
Burnham said , " and they know it . "
