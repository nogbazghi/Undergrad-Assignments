I saw the author at the Velo Swap in S.F. in December 2006 .
Gave a great presentation and his way of thinking fit my training regimen for my bicycling .
The style and presentation fit my mindset and when it is rainy , snowy , blowing or just do n't care .
You realize you are not alone and gives the tools and techniques that get you going .
Not your average mental training guide but new stuff and odd angles make you approach your workout and mind in a different way
