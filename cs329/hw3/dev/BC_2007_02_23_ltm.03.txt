The other thing is that often these cell phone companies -- not often , but once in a while -- they 'll send you something either in your bill or separately that indicates that they 've changed a fee , or change aid service , or some little thing in your contract has changed and have you an opt out clause .
Can you use that to get out of your contract .
Now , there 's a little time window there .
The other thing , can you transfer something .
Miles , if I think I do n't like my contract or I want something else , and you are prepared to take my contract because you just want a contract for a few months , I can transfer that contract to you .
We both agree on it , and my cell phone company will charge me a little fee to transfer it .
If you want to transfer and you ca n't find somebody to transfer to , choose two web sites to look at .
One of them is CellTradeUSA.com .
The other one is , resellular.com .
That 's resellular with an S. For a fee they will match you up with someone who is prepared to take your contract .
You 'll also probably have to pay a fee to the cell phone company that someone else can take your contract if you need out of it -- Miles .
So they 're assumable ?
That 's pretty good .
VELSH
They are assumable , that 's right .
You will pay some fee for it , but it might be less than that fee you pay to cancel your contract .
You know , it 's worth putting out , though , that those fees to back out , you are just paying for the phone you did n't pay for in the first place ?
So , keep that in mind .
That 's exactly right .
If you do n't like contracts , buy a phone separately .
All right .
One more tip you can do here is on home phone service ?
If you want to dump the phone company , you did it , I have done it .
Dump is such an ugly word .
Have you done it , Ali ?
I have done -- I mean , I use my cell phone all the time .
Oh , you do n't even have any sort of land line service ?
I have one of those VOIP land lines that you were talking about .
Vonage , or the like .
Yeah , Internet .
All right , Ali .
Thank you .
All right .
