Legislative Democrats unveiled two bills Monday to increase
punishments for sex offenders , a day before they are expected
to fight a governor-backed " Jessica 's Law " proposal in two public
safety committee hearings .
Several Democrats said Monday they oppose the " Jessica 's Law " plan because
they believe its requirement that sex offenders live at least
2,000 feet from any school or child-friendly park would essentially
move such offenders from cities to rural regions .
The Republican-backed " Jessica 's Law " plan , which Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger promoted in
his State of the State address last week , also includes
tougher punishments for various sex crimes and satellite GPS monitoring
of convicted sex offense felons .
In response , Democrats have submitted their own legislative plans to further
penalize sex offenders and increase monitoring .
The bills are in
preliminary stages and do not include a 2,000-foot barrier ; instead ,
they prohibit sex offenders from loitering around schools or locations
where children play .
Sen.
George Runner and Assemblywoman Sharon Runner , husband-and-wife Republicans from Lancaster ,
said their " Jessica 's Law " proposal will keep sexual predators away
from public areas in which children are vulnerable to abuse .
Besides their legislation , the Runners are gathering signatures for a statewide
ballot initiative they said they would pursue if lawmakers do
not send Schwarzenegger a bill by Feb. 15 .
" I 've got to believe we would not be having these discussions
if we were not currently right now out there gathering
signatures on an initiative , " said George Runner .
" This would not
be a priority as it seems to have become . "
Assemblyman Mark Leno , DSan Francisco and chair of the Assembly Public
Safety Committee , introduced his own proposal through a "gut and
amend " of his Assembly Bill 50 .
He said he is
willing to work with the Runners , but he opposes their
plan and warned them against using the initiative as a
" threat . "
Current law is less restrictive than the " Jessica 's Law " plan with
regard to living arrangements .
It is now illegal only for
those who sexually abuse children to live within one-quarter mile
( 1,320 feet ) of a K-8 school while on parole , though
high-risk offenders must now live a half-mile from any school .
The Runners ' proposed change would make it illegal for a registered
sex offender to live within 2,000 feet of any school
or park for life .
" These parolees are moving closer and closer to schools and parks
so they have a place where they can take these
children and molest them , " Sharon Runner said .
The Runners said Monday that their plan would not apply to
any registered sex offender whose parole already has expired --
that it only applies to those who are sentenced or
on parole after the law passes .
But their legislation -- Senate Bill 588 and Assembly Bill 231
-- states that it would be illegal for any sex
registrant to live within 2,000 feet of a park or
school .
Democrats said that means any of the state 's 86,000
sex registrants -- even those whose parole terms ended decades
ago -- would be forced out of most urban areas .
David LaBahn , executive director of the California District Attorneys Association , which
backs SB 588 and AB 231 , said that while the
law suggests all sex registrants would be forced to live
away from schools and parks , courts would be unlikely to
impose the rule on those who own their homes .
That means the rule could , however , apply to renters who ca n't
assert a constitutional property right .
George Runner said that if
his bill passes Tuesday , he would be willing to include
an explicit change that prevents his proposal from applying retroactively .

Niki Delson , a licensed clinical social worker who had treated sex
offenders and child victims in Humboldt County for more than
25 years , said that most child sex offenses involve relatives
and acquaintances .
" The most dangerous place for children is in their own homes
or the homes of relatives , and not in schools and
parks , " she said , criticizing the 2,000-foot rule .
" But there 's this
political swirl that we 're in , not only in California but
nationally .
It enrages the public and creates political capital and
nobody wants be accused of being soft on sex offenders . "
Rural Democrats on Monday raised fears that thousands of sex offenders
would be forced to relocate from cities to agricultural areas
such as the Central Valley .
" The area I represent has been dumped on by the sludge
haulers , it 's been dumped on by dairies and now we 're
going to be dumped on with a whole host of
sexual predators that come to our area if this proposal
actually comes to fruition , " said Sen. Dean Florez , D-Shafter .
At a press conference Monday , Florez , Sen. Elaine Alquist , D-San Jose ,
and Sen. Mike Machado , D-Linden , pointed to a series of
maps that showed most of San Francisco , Los Angeles and
even Sacramento would be off limits to registered sex offenders .
In Sacramento County , an estimated seven of 10 sex offenders registered
with the state live within 2,000 feet of a school
or park , according to a 2005 Bee analysis .
But the Runners -- who themselves live in the relatively sparse
Antelope Valley in Los Angeles County -- disputed the extent
to which sex offenders would flock to rural counties .
They
said offenders on parole are required to return to the
county in which they formerly resided -- and they said
that even after parole most people would choose to remain
in their home region .
" Jessica 's Law " is named after Jessica Lunsford , a 9-year-old who was
believed to have been kidnapped , molested and killed by a
convicted sex offender .
