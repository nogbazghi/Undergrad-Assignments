I do n't know , you know .
A -- a part of thinks he 's not but part of me thinks he is .
But I guess -- you know , I was talking with my husband about it and I -- the bottom line is whether he is dead or alive , he is totally never going to be in control of that country again .
That 's true , that is true .
So , I guess it really does n't matter but it would be nice to know th - -- you know , what his , you know , what -- if he is dead or alive , you know .
Yeah .
If those --
Yeah .
If those bombs hit .
It was pretty wild to , ah , to see , you know , his places and , you know , the luxury he lived in while his people suffered .
Yeah .
That was just , you know , amazing that he could do that .
So I -- I -- it just -- that whole culture pretty much amazes me .
Yeah .
And how abo- -- how about the Information or th - -- or should I say the Disinformation Minister ?
The guy who would always go on the news and say , " Oh --"
"-- we 're beating the Americans " you know .
I know , I know .
Was n't that funny ?
It 's like , gosh , like , this guy is living in a dream world .
Yeah .
I ca n't remember what his name was .
Um --
I ca n't either but I -- I could not believe he was going on there saying the things he was when we -- we knew , we knew what was going on .
I know .
See , that 's what I have felt about that culture a lot , you know .
Like , you know , even with the -- the guys who hijacked the planes , um , September eleventh , you know , how , " Oh no , th - they had nothing to do with it " you know .
It 's like th - -- they could be -- it 's kind of like a sociopathic --
-- society , you know , they believe their own lies .
It 's --
Yeah .
It 's just kind of strange --
-- you know , even when they 're caught red handed doing something it 's like they do n't --
-- they still wo n't admit to it , you know .
Yeah .
I mean , that 's what that Information Minister was doing , you know .
He was just , you know -- he 's -- they lie .
I -- I do n't understand it .
I -- I do n't understand that culture so ...
Oh , I do n't either .
I do n't .
And I guess I wo - -- I probably wo n't .
I know .
I -- I really ca n't .
I think , you know -- And we were discussing -- I do n't know -- this i- -- this is kind of funny too , ah , 'cause me and my husband were discussing like , you know , the French or -- ah , now they 're wanting to step in , you know , they want the -- what is it ?
The UN or whatever to ah -- or whatever --
