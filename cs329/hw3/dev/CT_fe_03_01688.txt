Um , I do n't know that they 'll tolerate us for months there , still fighting .
Uh , of course they ca n't stop us , but they can make a big outcry .
Right .
Um , I do n't know .
Y - you 're right though , if they can find Hussein and his sons and whoever the -- his top leaders are , they 'll wrap it up real fast .
I had heard that , uh , Saddam had murdered his own sons , but I do n't know if that was just a rumor , or -- 'cause I had heard it secondhand , not off the news --
Really ?
-- and I do n't know if this is true or not .
That 's interesting .
Why would he have , did they say ?
Um , my source --
Yeah .
-- which is just a manager at work , so not too reliable --
Yeah .
-- but all the same , said , uh , they were doing something like , um , drinking American beverage or something , just , you know --
Uh-huh .
-- a ridiculous reason .
Oh .
And so it was just retribution ?
Right .
That does sound like an urban legend , I 'm afraid .
It could have happened , though .
Oh --
I do n't know .
I have n't watched the news in the last few days , so
Yeah .
I did n't , 'cause , um , I get so tired of it , and my husband was away fishing , but he 's back now , so I 'm sure I 'll get all caught up .
But I saw enough of it to , you know , see that they felt we were nearly done , but then last night a young woman reporter was there , and I do n't know if you happened to see that , but I mean , she kept looking behind her and finally she just said , " That 's too close " and she kind of ducked down .
No, I did n't catch that .
So , they 're still fighting . .
So I think , by and large , the real thing is all done , the real fighting .
I hope so , 'cause I -- I do n't think that we went about it the right way , in Bush making such a large deal out of it --
Mm .
-- and the -- the whole United Nations --
What do you think would have been better ?
I really do n't know .
I do n't know --
Yeah .
-- how it would have been handled better , or how it could of , or if it --
-- would have been different under Gore , or an- any of these other declarations by the people .
Yeah .
I -- I do n't know , um , I tend to think that Gore , frankly , is kind of wimpy , so I do n't think --
-- I do n't think -- I do n't think he would have known what to do , and he 'd have just followed advisors , but , um , as far as whether -- I -- it did seem like Bush just -- this was just -- he was itching to do this .
