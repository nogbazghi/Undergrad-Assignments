Ordered according to the online pictures and description but when the bags arrived , I found they were not the same .
They 're white and wider than the original ones .
However I squeezed it into the chamber but it works .
The dust actually sucks into the bag .
Anyway , it 's better than nothing since there are no places I can buy the bags here in L.A.
