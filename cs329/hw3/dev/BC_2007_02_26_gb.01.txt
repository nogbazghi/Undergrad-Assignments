You are a Muslim .
How did you feel on September 11 as an American ?
Awful .
Innocent people died .
And I -- violence is violence .
Do you -- see , maybe I` m a different kind of guy .
Do you ever think , man , I mean , bigots are just so stupid , because if you just get to know people you can hate them for real reasons ?
Well , certainly bigots and racists are stupid .
Yes .
I mean , all you have to do is get to know somebody for a while , and you`ll find somebody to -- something to dislike about them .
Steven , thank you very much .
I appreciate it .
I` m sorry that you had to face that in Seattle .
Thanks for having me .
You bet .
" Titanic " director James Cameron has rocked the religious world .
He is claiming now he has found the tomb of Jesus , and Jesus was inside .
You do n` t want to miss this .
Stick around .
It` s coming up next .
All right , welcome to tonight` s " Real Story . "
JetBlue Airlines has made headlines all over the country with their Valentine` s Day hardship , when they had to cancel hundreds of flights and some passengers were stranded on their planes for up to 10 hours .
But " The Real Story " is that JetBlue was as much as a victim in the ordeal as anyone else .
Full disclosure here .
Dave Neeleman is the CEO of JetBlue , and he` s a very good friend of mine .
He was on the show the day after JetBlue` s Valentine` s Day crisis .
But even if Dave was n` t a friend , I`d be doing this story anyway , because JetBlue was just one of the airlines that was unfairly blamed for the problems at JFK.
Look , we can all agree that air travel is a pain in the neck .
Even at its best , security is a hassle .
They`re not serving peanuts anymore .
I usually end up getting stuck in the middle seat somewhere between a fat guy and an ADD-riddled 7-year-old , which is especially horrible , since I have ADD myself , riddled with it .
And then there are the lovely delays .
Now , there are plenty of times when it is the airlines` fault and they should be held accountable .
But it` s beginning to look like this was n` t one of those times .
It was a lot more than just a little snow and ice storm that doomed JetBlue to their cold day in Hell .
Just like you and me , the air traffic officials at New York` s JFK airport check the weather forecast and they plan ahead .
Do you remember that " I Love Lucy " episode where Lucy ca n` t keep up the candy conveyor belt and the whole operation starts to fall apart ?
Well , if airport officials do n` t keep track of every possible detail , especially the weather , the same thing would happen , only , instead of candy , you`d see a major pileup of hundreds of planes that , you know , flying in and out of JFK each and every day , and we` d be on one of them .
But on February 13th , that` s exactly what happened .
A huge nor`easter was getting ready to dump snow , hail , and ice all over the New York City area .
FAA officials in Virginia rejected JFK` s request to switch to a winter storm plan .
The command center ordered one of the world` s busiest airports to operate as though it was business as usual .
And it started to snow and hail , and the temperature dropped .
Planes landed and could n` t be deiced in time .
And then the outgoing flights started getting cancelled by the dozens .
