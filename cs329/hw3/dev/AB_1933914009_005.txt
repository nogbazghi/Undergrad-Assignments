I am a fan of the quick hits self-help books with less story , more inspiration - like " The Success Principles " which has so many small chunks .
Kim 's book is written a story of her college friends from Hawaii and how they all end up .
Along the way we learn about investments .
There are some great points on :
- Reasons why women are ( and can be ) great investors , and also the stupid things women do in relation to money
- Why women need to get into investments - of the elderly in poverty , 75 % are women and most were n't poor when their husband was alive
- Why investing options are great for women as you can work on your own terms , there is no earning ceiling and it can fit round family
- Using your personal reason why to create success
- A real asset is one that puts money in your pocket - and how to create assets
If you are new to wealth ideas , then it is highly recommended .
If you have already read all Rich Dad , Poor Dad books - there is not much new material here .
However , I did enjoy the book as it comes from a different angle and cements ideas that occur throughout wealth literature .
