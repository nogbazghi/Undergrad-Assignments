Patricia Gussin is on my list from here on out : I have n't read her other work , but I 'm looking forward to it after picking this one up on a whim .
When a heart surgeon finds her husband in bed with his sexy co-anchor at the news station , she knows her first priority is making sure her family is all right .
But when she 's arrested for the anchorwoman 's murder , she 's left at the mercy of the justice system and her increasingly unhinged husband .
Every twist and reveal feels organic , which does n't often happen in thrillers .
I really enjoyed the way her characters make bad decisions on occasion and keep secrets from one another in recognizable ways that do n't just serve to move the plot forward in arbitrary fashion .
Really strong , enjoyable read .
