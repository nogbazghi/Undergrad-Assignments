President George W. Bush can not run for another term in office , of course .
But he will play a role in the presidential campaigns as either a target or an ally ?
That means his approval ratings still matter .
Senior political analyst Bill Schneider crunches the latest poll numbers for us .
The latest batch of polls is in , and the news is not good for President Bush .
Five polls taken in mid-January show the president 's job approval rating at very low levels .
The CBS News figure , 28 percent , is the lowest figure ever for this president .
Our poll of polls gives us an average of 32 percent approval , 63 percent disapproval .
Nearly 2 to 1 negative .
So what , you might ask .
Bush ca n't run again .
A job rating is a measure of the president 's clout .
This president has a lot of things he wants to get done in his last two years besides Iraq .
Health care , for instance .
We proposed a bold initiative .
Congress is not likely to follow a deeply unpopular president .
The public sees this president as a lame duck .
Seventy- one percent do not think he will have the support he needs to get things done .
Members of the president 's own party are distancing themselves , particularly on his troop build-up in Iraq .
I 'm very concerned about the American G.I. being thrust in the middle in the violence that really has root causes that go back a thousand years .
Only four presidents since World War II have seen their job ratings drop below 30 percent .
Harry Truman chose not to run for reelection in 1952 .
Richard Nixon was forced to resign .
Jimmy Carter was fired after one term .
So was Bush 's father in 1992 .
When you 're this low , the voters consider your presidency over .
Is that the way they feel about President Bush ?
Apparently .
Fifty- eight percent in the " Newsweek " poll said they personally wished George W. Bush 's presidency were over .

Well , Democrats in the U.S. Congress are looking at ways to flex their new political muscle when it comes to the war in Iraq .
The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on legislative war powers and what constitutional options Congress might have to force an end to the conflict .
Lawmakers heard from a lineup of legal scholars .
Now the Senate also set to start debating a nonbinding resolution on Iraq , that would declare that the U.S. president 's proposals to send in more U.S. troops is not in the national interests .
But what would such a resolution really accomplish ?
Bob Franken gives us a closer look ?
I 'm the decisionmaker .
I had to come up with a way forward that precluded disaster .
BOB FRANKEN , CNN NATL.
CORRESPONDENT (voice-over ) The president makes it clear he 's the commander in chief .
The Constitution says he gets to decide how he uses the troops in his command .
But the Constitution also gives Congress the power of the perk purse .
However , there is no serious plan to cut off funding for the additional troops .
So why bother with nonbinding resolutions ?
