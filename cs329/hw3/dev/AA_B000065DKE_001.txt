I had ordered this set of 2 filters earlier from a different company and they sent me just one filter and never acknowledged my phone calls about it .
I finally did get a promise that they would send the missing filter after several e-mails , and then I got an e-mail stating that they could not send me the other filter and refunded my money .
Target sent very promptly and the correct package of 2 filters .
Buyer beware where you order from ! ! ! TARGET was really great .
