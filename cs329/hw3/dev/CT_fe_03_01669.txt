Mhm .
Oh , wow .
[inaudible ] should talk then about that .
And that 's how you get paid which actually I just got a thing , um , you can refer people and get a dollar for each person you refer .
Yeah , I just got that today too .
Well , I just signed up like Friday or Saturday .
Oh .
And I did n't expect to get a call this soon .
Well , I actually just called in .
You can call in for a phone call , that 's what I just did .
Oh .
I called in 'cause I have n't --
Well , you 're my first .
I -- I have n't had a phone call in a while --
Oh .
So I was like , well , ah , you can get three phone calls so I called in today .
Oh , yeah .
Can use some more shucks .
Yep.
Oh , um , I wonder h - how do they expect us to talk for ten minutes on the Middle East ?
I know , about that one topic .
I 'm not that -- I 'm not that , um , sophisticatedly educated or whatever .
Or that .
So what have you seen on the news about that topic ?
On the news ?
Um , that they 're still looking for all the -- the -- all of Saddam 's , you know , head guys and ...
Do you think they 're in Syria ?
I do n't know .
That 's what my husband was saying weeks ago .
He 's , um , he 's studied a lot more on world history than most of us Americans .
Mhm .
He 's from England and he thinks they 're in Syria .
He was saying that long before they ever said that on the news .
He said , " Saddam 's in Syria" .
I do n't know , I just hope --
They just need to find him and --
And I hope they find him and they find --
And kill him before they come over here and start doing stuff over here .
Yeah .
And find Osama too .
Before he sends more terrorists over here .
Yup .
Th- well , ther- there 's already like plenty of terrorists over here .
Yeah ?
Ah , you can guarantee that .
They 're probably just waiting for the word to s - before they start striking and doing stuff over here .
Yeah .
I he- --
I heard that they 're -- they 're watching , like , a few people that they have suspects over here .
Yeah ?
I think like over in Miami or something .
But ...
Wow .
Oh well .
But they -- they need to take all of Saddam 's stuff and sell it .
Yeah .
I saw like a whole bunch of pictures , like inside his palace and all that stuff .
Mhm .
Instead of destroying his palace , take the stuff and sell it .
