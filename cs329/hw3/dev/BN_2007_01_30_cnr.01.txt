Testimony continues this morning in the perjury trial of Lewis " Scooter " Libby .
Former " New York Times " reporter Judith Miller is scheduled to appear .
Miller , you may remember , went to prison for 85 days .
She had refused to reveal Libby as her source .
Her testimony will follow an appearance by a key prosecution witness yesterday .
CNN 's Brian Todd has that story .
A pivotal moment for prosecutors .
Their witnesses offer a window into the spin machine of the Bush White House , a machine that prosecutors contend went into overtime in the summer of 2003 , countering claims by this war critic , former ambassador Joe Wilson , that the White House twisted intelligence to justify the invasion of Iraq .
The star witness , the one time public face of the White House .
Former press secretary Ari Fleischer testified about a private conversation he shared with Vice President Cheney 's point man , Lewis " Scooter " Libby .
Fleischer says Libby told him Wilson 's wife worked at the CIA .
He told the court he believes Libby even divulged her name , Valerie Plame-Wilson , and that Libby said the information was "hush-hush . "
Fleischer says that meeting occurred on July 7 , 2003 , three days before Libby claims he learned Plame 's classified identity from Tim Russert of NBC News .
It can be illegal to knowingly out a CIA operative , but Libby is on trial for lying to federal investigators .
Libby claims he forgot details of his conversations about Plame .
The prosecution is trying to show the jury that even in the life -- a day of the life of Lewis Libby , this issue was so important to the vice president that it is n't something that he would forget .
But on cross-examination , the defense punches holes in Fleischer 's memory , asking , " Can you say with absolute certainty that Libby said Plame 's name ? " Fleischer 's answer , " With absolute certainty , no . "
Fleischer got him immunity from prosecution because he thought he 'd be in trouble for telling reporters that Wilson 's wife worked for the CIA before it was reported publicly .
Fleischer contends he did not give Plame 's name to reporters and did n't realize until much later that her identity was classified .
