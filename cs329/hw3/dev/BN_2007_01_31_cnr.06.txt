And what you can see is , they have that brown bag there .
And you can see investigators .
They 're taking a closer look at some of the evidence there at the scene after this detonation that went on .
And it 's eerily similar to what we saw unfold a few hours ago , the scene over at Sullivan Station at the T-stop over there near Interstate 93 , where they detonated a device over there , as well .
So , you can see that huge police presence , and , as we heard from Grant Greenberg , who was down at the Longfellow Bridge .
We have also heard from Ryan Schulteis .
All right .
You 're listening to a Boston affiliate there , WCVB.
That 's their local coverage .
I imagine this is huge news , obviously , in Boston .
Bill Daly , I want to get back to you , former FBI investigator from Boston .
Talk to us about , post-9/11 , after 9/11 , the precautions and things that were put in place in Boston to handle situations like this .
And I imagine that 's what we 're seeing in action now .
Well , you know , all the major cities , including Boston , have put together plans , and have tested out those plans , to respond to situations such as this , where there may be multiple devices left , whether be found or unfound to be actual explosive devices themselves ...
Right .
... and to be able to deal with the public safety issues that may be surrounding it , as well as if they are found out to contain explosive materials , or if one was to go off , they have also tested and planned to be able to respond and to bring aid to those who might be injured .
All right , Bill , we 're going to and we 're going to thank you so much for joining us .
And we 're going to keep you around just so we can get some information from you .
But we want to get to one of our correspondents , who also has information .
Thanks , Bill Daly .
Jeanne Meserve , our homeland security correspondent , working her sources .
Jeanne , are you finding out new information right now ?
Hi , Kyra .
Yes , we have just heard from a federal security official , who requested anonymity , because this investigation is an ongoing one , that the packages found this afternoon appear to be the same type as one discovered this morning near the Sullivan Square T-station .
That 's MBTA.
The package found this morning , as you know , was determined not to be an IED , but it did contain a circuit board .
And , according to this federal security official , the circuit board lights -- lit up like a smiley face and a middle finger , this , again , according to a federal security official .
A Department of Homeland Security official says that several of these devices now have been cleared , and this per the Boston Police Department .
The ones that the Boston Police Department has told the Department of Homeland Security have been cleared are the ones at I- 93 , the New England Medical Center , and at Stuart and Columbus .
The term used in talking to me was hoaxes .
And if these devices looked as we 're told they are by that one federal official , with a smiley face and a middle finger , that would indeed appear to be the case .
