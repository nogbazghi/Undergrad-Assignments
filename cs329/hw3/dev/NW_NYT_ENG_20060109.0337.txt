" We frequently call them insurgents , " Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told a
news conference late last year .
" I 'm a little reluctant to ,
for some reason .
They 're against a legitimate government . "
Gen .
Peter Pace , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , at
Rumsfeld 's side , told the reporters that U.S. , Iraqi and coalition
forces were " taking cities from the -- I have to
use the word 'insurgent ' because I ca n't think of a
better word right now ... . " Rumsfeld quickly put in , " Enemies of
the legitimate Iraqi government -- how 's that ? "
Insurgent , from the Latin insurgere , " to rise up , " means " a rebel ,
one who revolts against an established government . "
The insurgent in
rebellion does not have the status of a belligerent , rooted
in Latin for "waging war , " and thus does not have
the protections in law of a member of a state
at war .
Why , then , was Rumsfeld eager to get away
from the term insurgent ?
One reason , I think , is that
the word has gained more of a political connotation than
a legal one in the U.S. ; it is often applied
to a group seeking to oust the leadership of a
political party or a union , and insurgents in that context
can refer to admirable "underdogs " in a struggle against the
established order or entrenched leadership .
Another reason : it unifies disparate
elements into an "insurgency . "
The day after that news conference , President Bush delivered a speech
to the Naval Academy defining the enemy in Iraq as
" a combination of rejectionists , Saddamists and terrorists . "
Gone was insurgents ;
in addition , a previous category of " Saddam loyalists " was shortened
to Saddamists because loyalty , even to a tyrant , can be
seen as an attribute .
In the Bush lexicon , rejectionists are
mainly resentful Sunnis who can be brought into the Iraqi
democratic fold ; Saddamists are the tyrant 's favorites " who still harbor
dreams of returning to power " ; and terrorists , a term from
the French Revolution , are al-Qaida "foreigners who are coming to
fight freedom 's progress in Iraq . "
By refusing to accept the lumping of the three disparate groups
into an insurgency , the Bush administration hopes to publicly separate
the most violent factions from the more reachable current rejectionists .
In wartime , words are weapons ; we have seen how Israelis and
Palestinians are highly sensitive to connotations in their conflict .
Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon preferred to refer to land in dispute
west of the Jordan River by biblical names : Judea and
Samaria , evoking Hebrew origins ; Israeli diplomats long tried "administered territories . "
Palestinians call it the West Bank and have won that
terminological battle .
On another word-war front , the construction within the West Bank to
protect Israelis from rocket attacks and penetration by suicide bombers
is called " the wall " by Palestinians intending to evoke memories
of the cold war 's hated Berlin Wall .
Israelis counter by
calling it " the fence , " a less onerous and more familiar
description of a line of separation , recalling to Americans the
Robert Frost poetic line " Good fences make good neighbors . "
( In
fact , it is both fence and wall , depending on the
place . )
After perusal of thesauri , the Bush administration adopted the
undeniably accurate word barrier , which has been accepted as neutral
by much of the news media and stirs no objection
by Israel .
TO IR - IS HUMAN
The Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group , Steven Erlanger of The Times
reported , noted that more than half the violent deaths in
areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority were from gunshot wounds
caused by other Palestinians ; the group deplored the authority 's "irresponsiveness
to the civil unrest in Gaza and the West Bank . "
We will now veer from Mideastisms to deal with an English
prefix .
That was the first time I had seen irresponsiveness .
Although the noun can be found in some dictionaries and
a few hundred times in a search-engine roundup , it is
rarely used .
Even the adjective from which it is back-formed
-- irresponsive -- is not part of our working vocabularies ,
as most of us prefer near synonyms like " sullen , close ,
tight-lipped " or choose phrases like "lack of response " or "failure
to react . "
You can find unresponsive , but thereby hangs a
tale :
That got me wondering about ir- words , from irresponsible to irreverent ,
and irrespective to irrational .
There 's no doubt about the meaning
of the prefix ir-; it means "not . "
Why , then , do n't
we use the standard prefixes that turn around a word 's
meaning , like in- or un-?
The reason is that language is created to fit the mouth .
It is easier to pronounce irresolute than inresolute or unresolute ,
which is why those clunkier forms never got off the
ground .
Somewhere in the mist of early mouthings , English speakers
found the n uncomfortable before words beginning with r .
So
-- why not scrap the "inr , " with its two separate
sounds , and go with a simple "ir-" ?
In most cases
we dropped the n of in-, leaving only the i ,
pronounced "ih . "
Then , because spelling is the handmaiden of pronunciation ,
when it came to writing down the way the word
sounded , we decided to double the r .
Who is this mysterious "we " telling us what sounds to elide
and how to spell them ?
It is the native speaker
-- our malleable paramour , Norma Loquendi -- who makes changes
in language to make it easier to communicate , irregardless of
the strictures of formalistic word mavens .
And what of irregardless -- as so many readers ask , is
that a word ?
The opening ir- means "not " or "without "
and the closing -less also means "without , " which turns the
locution into arrant nonsense .
First cited in Harold Wentworth 's dialect
dictionary in 1912 , irregardless was probably intended to be a
joke , and the deliberate mistake is today used with humorous
intent , although some do n't get the joke and make the
mistake .
Because it is mainly a jocular word , the answer
is yes , irregardless is a word , and that is why
lexicographers put it in dictionaries with a rolling of the
eyes and a warning not to take it seriously .
