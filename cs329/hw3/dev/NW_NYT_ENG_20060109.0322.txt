Today 's question :
( EDITORS : BEGIN ITALS )
There was an article in the newspaper about researchers who had
discovered the largest prime number .
It 's 9.1million digits long .
I 'm
sure there is a wonderful scientific reason to discover this .
I just ca n't figure out what it is .
Why is
it important to know this ?
( EDS : END ITALS )
Let 's back up a bit and fill in the details .
In December , researchers at Central Missouri State University announced that they
had discovered the biggest prime number ever , and it includes
9.1 million digits .
It took about nine years using a
network of about 700 computers around campus to do this .
Now , as you no doubt recall from math class , a prime
number is any positive number other than 1 that can
be divided only by 1 and itself .
For starters , 2 ,
3 , 5 and 7 are prime numbers .
Personally , I can take prime numbers or leave them alone .
But
if you are of a certain mathematical bent , prime numbers
are pretty hot stuff , and people have been studying them
since the time of Euclid and assorted other ancient Greeks .
Anyway , why did they go to all that time and effort
to find a prime with 9.1 million digits ?
There are
a few reasons .
I found this quote from Steven Boone , one of the researchers
involved , in an article from the " Guardian " : " People ask why
we do this .
It 's like going on a quest .
We 're
looking for something incredibly rare . "
In other words , they kind of did it for the hell
of it .
Second , there is money involved .
An outfit called the Electronic Frontier
Foundation has offered a $ 100,000 prize for finding a 10
million-digit prime number .
And prime numbers do have their uses , so I suppose the
bigger the prime the better .
For one thing , prime numbers
are used for hash tables .
I have no idea what
a hash table is and for what I get paid ,
I 'm not about to look it up .
But prime numbers are especially dandy things when you are dealing
with computer encryption .
That 's what lets you do online banking
or order stuff by computer using your credit card .
This involves a bunch of math we wo n't go into here ,
but one thing I read said a computer that could
check 1 trillion numbers a second would take about 122
quadrillion ( EDITORS : "quadrillion " IS IN ITALS IN ORIGINAL ) years to
exhaust all possibilities involved in breaking a typical 128-bit encryption
based on prime numbers .
I have no idea if that
is really true , but those are some pretty impressive numbers ,
do n't you think ?
