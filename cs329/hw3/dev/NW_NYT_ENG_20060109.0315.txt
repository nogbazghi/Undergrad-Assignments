Residents of the San Fernando Valley bought slightly
fewer homes last year than in 2004 but the market
remained strong as the median resale price hit a record
for the sixth consecutive year , according to preliminary results for
December .
Last month 's 892 single-family home sales pushed the 2005 total to
12,569 transactions , the eighth-straight 12,000-plus year , according to the Southland
Regional Association of Realtors , based in the Van Nuys community
in L.A.
December 's median price , the point at which half the homes cost
more and half less , was $ 590,000 .
That 's $ 10,000 under November 's
$ 600,000 record and guarantees another annual mark .
While final figures are not expected until later in the week ,
it appears that annual price appreciation could be in the
20 percent range .
That would compare favorably with the past
three annual increases of 26.3 percent , 21.3 percent and 19.6
percent .
Association executives and market analysts had predicted that 2005 would be
another banner year -- it 's the 10th best sales-wise since
at least 1984 , but there were some surprises .
" In fact the market was stronger than we thought it would
be .
In price appreciation we did not expect the 20-percent-plus
increase , " said Jim Link , the association 's executive vice president .
In December the median price ranged from a high of $ 1.6
million in Calabasas to a low of $ 480,000 in San
Fernando .
But the latter is $ 6,240 more than the average
median price for the entire Valley in 2004 .
And there were four other communities -- Tarzana , Encino , Toluca Lake
and Studio City -- with a $ 1 million-plus median price .
The smaller condominium market was likewise robust .
December 's 340 sales boosted
the full-year total to 4,717 , the fifth-highest ever .
And the condo median price of $ 390,000 , just under the November
record of $ 393,500 , also guarantees another yearly mark .
There is a consensus that sales are past the peak for
this market 's cycle but owners and shoppers are in for
a gentle letdown rather than a collapse .
In fact , some
believe that the first part of next year will see
continued strong sales with narrower appreciation gains .
" We do n't think prices are going to come down and we
do think it would be good for the rate of
appreciation to moderate , " Link said .
The wild card is mortgage interest rates .
They have began moving
up but still are low historically .
But each increase pushes
more potential buyers out of the market , especially one in
which the least expensive home is just shy of half
a million dollars .
John Karevoll , a market analyst at La Jolla-based DataQuick Information Systems ,
said there are no fundamental signs of weakness across Southern
California .
Supplies , while building some , remain tight and demand strong .
Nor is it unusual for sales to fall because they have
been at high levels for an extended period .
Lower-end homes are selling faster and appreciating faster than those at
the high end of the market , something typical of a
market at this point in its cycle , he said .
Karevoll said this year should not bring a huge change , either .
" This is a supertanker , and you do n't turn those things 90
degrees on a dime . "
