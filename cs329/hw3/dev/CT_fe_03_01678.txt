Yeah .
Um , oh , well , I -- you know , I -- I guess I do n't necessarily question or say that that 's wrong --
Mhm .
I mean , I just say that their motivations for w- why they choose to support or not support a war in Iraq are complicated --
Right .
-- are complex .
Mhm .
And , uh , you know , I -- I think that there is also a large sentiment too , that , uh , many of the problems in Iraq , uh , we had a -- a major role in -- in developing .
Really ?
What do you mean by that ?
In -- in -- our past support of -- of Saddam --
Mhm .
-- in his war against Iran --
Mhm .
-- and , uh , you know , we , um , the -- uh , what was it ?
The a lot of impact of -- yu - -- one heard quite a bit about how if we ever found m - -- weapons of mass destruction , they 'd probably would largely say , " Made in the USA " on them .
Right , right .
Uh , that we supported them i- i- in terms of even arms , providing arms to Iraq .
And , uh , you know , in a -- in a sense I could n't blame other countries for saying we made the problem , we can deal with the problem .
Mhm .
We 're on our own .
Hm .
I -- I think that there 's a lot of history there that , uh , you know , [inaudible ] used to be the ambassador to Iraq and , uh --
Mm .
-- um , a lot of -- there 's this whole , uh , reparation thing with , uh , Bectal[ ? ] Corporation moving right in and --
Mhm .
-- taking over , uh , with , uh , uh , what 's his name ?
Ronnie[ ? ] Bectal that , uh , used to be Reagan 's , uh , Secretary of State , I think he was ?
Can't -- I ca n't say I honestly remember .
Yeah , yeah .
But , uh --
Um , Bectal [several inaudible words ] for all sorts of money after being one of the largest campaign contributors to the Republican party and President Bush .
So , you view this war as , uh , solely -- I -- I do n't know , like --
I -- I view it -- do n't view it solely as anything --
Mhm .
-- and I just see a whole lot of negative motivations going on --
Mhm .
-- and from all different sorts of angles here --
Mhm .
-- that , uh , I just see very little truly good coming from it --
-- you know , and -- and I ca n't say that I blame the average Iraqi sitting over there without electric , without water , without much of anything , being really pleased that they 're free now of Saddam .
Right .
You know ?
They may have had it --
W- Well -- oh well , but I mean , is n't that a positive -- positive result of this war , and I mean --
