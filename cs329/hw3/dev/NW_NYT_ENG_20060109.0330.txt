As world winemakers increasingly salivate over the rising
curve of U.S. wine consumption , California vintners can defend their
sizable lead by linking themselves to powerful , favorable images of
the state among wine buyers , says a new marketing survey .
The survey of 2,442 U.S. wine drinkers being presented today to
wine industry leaders in Napa bodes well for California 's continuing
hold on U.S. consumers -- and prospects for the state 's
$ 45 billion industry -- survey officials said .
Consumers surveyed expressed more familiarity with and favorability to California wines
than those of 11 other regions that include the countries
of Italy , France and Australia , and the states of Oregon ,
Washington and New York .
But the industry-financed survey signals the need , survey officials said , for
a more distinctive "message " that connects wine to positive associations
U.S. wine drinkers have with California 's environment , beauty and way
of life .
Women , likewise , could become a bigger marketing target based on findings
that they buy more wine in most price segments , enjoy
wine in small intimate settings and choose their wine to
enhance an experience .
" California is well-positioned now , and that 's a good thing , " said Peter
Rose , partner with North Carolina based market researcher Yankelovich Inc.
" But we want to be sure California does n't become the
hare to the tortoise of the rest of the world , "
he said .
Though California wines account for a commanding 67 percent of wine
consumed domestically , the state 's share has slipped by eight percentage
points in 10 years as winemakers from Australia , Chile and
South Africa have muscled in alongside traditional European competitors .
Individual wine consumption in the United States , fueled by the baby
boom generation and a new crop of wine drinkers in
their 20s , has grown to 3 gallons of wine yearly ,
up from 2.5 gallons a decade ago , according to the
Wine Institute .
Institute officials said their survey is the first comprehensive look at
U.S. wine consumers in more than 20 years and is
designed to boost competitiveness of California wines nationally .
" It 's a first step to give our membership some tools .
We
want to get it out to members and develop some
messages , " said institute spokeswoman Gladys Horiuchi .
Despite new competitors , the survey showed nearly eight in 10 wine
drinkers nationally hail the taste of California wines , and three-fourths
believe they are a good value for the money .
Australian wines made the second-best showing .
More than six in 10
respondents said the Southern Hemisphere wines have a "taste that 's
easy to enjoy , " and 58 percent called them a good
value .
Rose said wine drinkers are more likely than the general U.S.
population to consider themselves open to new experiences and adventures ,
a trait that can be turned to California 's advantage .
The
industry 's hope is to steer more experimentation nationally toward California 's
wide array of varietals and wine regions , including the Napa
and Sonoma valleys , Central Coast , Sierra Nevada foothills and Lodi .
" We 're trying to say you do n't have to go to Australia
to have an adventure .
You can go to Santa Barbara , "
said Barbara Insel , managing director for St . Helena-based MKF Research
LLC .
Insel is developing ways for California 's wine industry to
align its marketing efforts with the state 's positive images .
The 56-question online survey was conducted Sept. 7-13 among a representative
and random sample of the U.S. population that drinks wine
more than twice a year and is responsible for most
of the wine purchased at home .
