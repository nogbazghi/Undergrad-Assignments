Kimo von Oelhoffen , whose ancestry is a blend of
Hawaiian and German , can come across as a 300-pound exotic .
From the time he arrived on the mainland , no one knew
quite what to make of him .
Von Oelhoffen ( pronounced OHL-hoffen )
did not play football in high school and did not
have a full career in college .
When he joined the
Pittsburgh Steelers ' defensive line , he would throw tires as part
of his training regimen and keep a sewing machine in
his locker so he could stitch teammates ' jerseys in his
spare time .
Von Oelhoffen has the strength of a bodybuilder and the touch
of a tailor .
Like many defensive linemen , he can seem
both brutish and gentle .
The rugged side of him came out Sunday , when Cincinnati quarterback
Carson Palmer threw his first pass .
As von Oelhoffen crashed
into Palmer 's left leg and forced him to the ground ,
he could hear ligaments tear in Palmer 's knee .
By the
time television cameras focused on von Oelhoffen , he looked devastated .
Palmer had not even reached the locker room and a
debate was raging at Paul Brown Stadium about the legitimacy
of the hit , as well as the hitter .
Clean or
dirty ?
Character witnesses were busy gathering evidence on the field .
Cincinnati players berated von Oelhoffen while Pittsburgh players tried to
defend him .
Palmer 's injury , a torn anterior cruciate ligament , serves as the latest
reminder that every team in the playoffs is one hit
away from elimination .
The image of Palmer , carted off the
field after his first and only playoff pass , will hang
over this weekend 's games between the Redskins and the Seahawks ,
the Patriots and the Broncos , the Panthers and the Bears ,
and the Steelers and the Colts .
All of those teams
have stars they cannot afford to lose .
Just as the Steelers and the Bengals faced each other twice
in the regular season -- a footnote that raised the
intensity of their final meeting -- every divisional playoff game
this weekend is also a rematch .
Defensive linemen know offensive
linemen .
Defensive backs know receivers .
When high emotions meet high
stakes , any collision could have damaging consequences .
" In the playoffs , teams have to worry about injuries , " Pittsburgh receiver
Hines Ward said .
" It is still a part of football
and people have to deal with it . "
When von Oelhoffen was asked about his hit against Palmer , he
initially sounded callous .
" I 'm going to answer this question one
time , " von Oelhoffen said after the game .
" I was playing
football .
He was playing football .
No more , no less . "
But there was much more .
" I just hope that kid gets
better , " von Oelhoffen said .
" He is a great football player .
My apologies go out to him and his family . "
As von Oelhoffen spoke , a sympathetic side of him emerged .
" That 's
the risk we all take playing this game , " he said .
" It affected me .
I 'd feel the same way if I
was watching TV and I saw a quarterback tear his
ACL . "
The most destructive play of von Oelhoffen 's career is already the
most famous .
If von Oelhoffen had not hit Palmer , the
Steelers might not be playing the Colts on Sunday .
While
Palmer is expected to have reconstructive surgery , van Oelhoffen is
preparing to harass another Pro Bowl quarterback , Peyton Manning .
Defensive linemen have a tricky job description : to inflict as much
damage as possible without causing serious injury .
Von Oelhoffen , attempting
to straddle that narrow chalk line , said he tried to
hit Palmer without hurting him .
" I do n't know Kimo very well , " Cincinnati receiver T.J. Houshmandzadeh said .
" But I talked to him through the course of the
game and I do n't think he 's a dirty player . "
If anything , von Oelhoffen 's determination might have been to blame .
Just
as every pass rusher is taught , he fought through a
series of blocks and lunged at the quarterback .
According to
The Associated Press , Cincinnati coach Marvin Lewis said Monday that
von Oelhoffen should have been penalized for a late hit ,
but Palmer absolved the lineman of any wrongdoing .
After watching
a replay , Palmer said , " I do n't think it was malicious
at all . "
Considering where von Oelhoffen came from , it is remarkable that he
is even on a playoff roster .
He grew up in
Kaunakakai , Hawaii , attending Molokai High School , which did not field
a football team .
He went to the University of Hawaii ,
then to Walla Walla ( Wash . )
Junior College , and finally to
Boise State , where he was injured for part of two
seasons .
Although von Oelhoffen is a 12-year NFL veteran -- he spent
half of his career with the Bengals , oddly enough --
only recently have fans learned to pronounce his name .
He
has 19 1/2 sacks in the past five seasons , startling
because the Steelers play a 3-4 defense , which usually occupies
linemen in the trenches and showcases the linebackers .
Neither he nor his teammates would acknowledge the obvious -- that
hurting an opposing quarterback helps to beat the opposing team ,
and that hurting Palmer improved the chances of a victory
in Cincinnati .
Without Palmer , the Bengals ' passing game could not
fly .
Now , the Steelers will have to beat the AFC 's best .
The
last time Pittsburgh met Indianapolis , Nov. 28 at the RCA
Dome , Manning threw an 80-yard touchdown pass on the Colts '
first offensive play , leading to a 26-7 Colts ' victory .
The Steelers will probably not divulge much of their defensive strategy ,
but it seems there is only one way for them
to slow Manning : hit him as hard and as often
as possible .
