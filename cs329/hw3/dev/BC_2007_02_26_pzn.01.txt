And , of course , you know , the -- the -- the domination of the hip-hop industry culturally has accentuated that phenomenon .
You know , before the civil rights revolution , there was a term that we used in the black community : You have to be a credit to your race .
And being a credit to your race was not being a ghetto fabulous thug.
Being a credit to your race was being academically more competitive , being a decent human being , and being mainstream America .
Do you buy into , Danyel , what Niger is saying , that this is self-imposed ?
Or is this something beyond the black culture , that ...
I think ...
... that this victimization is feeding off of something else ?
I think it has been going on for so , so long .
I think it goes all the way back to slave times .
If you were the type of slave that wanted to work in the big house , you were the house N-word , there was always this association , like , if you 're white , you 're better .
I really do n't put a value system on it .
I do n't think it 's ...
Are you embarrassed by this , to see these kids talking about ...
I 'm not embarrassed by it .
. . failing classes because they do n't want to be accused of being too white ?
I mean , I agree .
I think it 's tragic .
I think it 's terrible .
And I just wonder , though , where are these kids ' parents ?
These are good , smart students in good schools .
Where are their parents ?
My mother was there to tell me .
My father was there to tell me .
I 'm wondering , where are people to tell them , this is not necessary ?
There 's no such thing as acting white .
There 's being a good student .
There 's being a good person .
There 's no such thing as acting white .
And being black does n't mean you are lazy or you have to be thugged out or anything like that .
I do take issue a little bit that hip-hop has exacerbated it .
But I just feel like you can be a kid ...
You have got to -- you have got to agree that the worst elements in hip-hop have .
I mean , there are more ...
Possibly .
But I do believe that , just because you wear baggy pants and you have your hair cut a certain way does not mean that you are a thug and does not mean that you ca n't excel in high school or college .
What kind of white trap is this for black kids ?
What kind of white trap ?
Yes .
I mean , you know , the -- the ...
Let me tell you , Paula...
It 's the man .
It 's the man that is responsible .
He has to defend his whole race .
... me as the representative ...
There are two of us here .
... as the representative of the white ...
No, there are two of us .
... of the white race at the table , yes .
Last time I looked , I thought I was white , too .
Well , no , there you ...
What I was going to say , if I can answer a different question , was , what is interesting to me is this does n't just happen in the black community .
I mean , I have seen it happen in the gay community in terms of some people concerned that some gay people want to get too married .
Are they trying to be straight ?
Like they 're trying to buy in to the straight culture ?
