Well , money was a part of this debate as well , right ?
No, that 's exactly right , and it always has been .
In the past , for instance , younger pilots or pilots who have been laid off , have always been in favor of there not being an increase in the retirement age because that creates more room at the top for them .
That creates opportunity for them .
But as you know , with some of the bankruptcies of airlines in recent years , pretty much some pilots have seen their pensions just evaporate .
So this gives them a chance to work for five more years and , of course , make their personal financial situation better .
So what 's your take ?
When could this proposal go into effect ?
Well , talking with an FAA spokesperson today , they told me that it could take several months .
It could take as long as two years .
It 's really a long process here of formal proposal , taking public comments and then laying out a time line .
All right .
Brianna , thanks .

PHILLIP
And Tyra Banks fighting back against reports that she 's fat .
We 've got the skinny on this weighty issue , straight ahead from the NEWSROOM.
Hello , everyone .
I 'm Kyra Phillips , live at the CNN world headquarters in Atlanta .
And I 'm Don Lemon .
" You have breast cancer . "
Almost 2,000 American women will hear those words this year .
What do you know ?
More importantly , what do n't you know about breast cancer ?
We 'll tell you about it today in the CNN NEWSROOM.
But first , you 're probably not losing much sleep over how much Tyra Banks weighs or does n't weigh and neither is she , but she does want to set the record straight .
CNN 's Sibila Vargas reports .
Tyra Banks scantily clad is hardly headline news .
This is , after all , the angelic catwalker whose 5'10 " body sold lingerie and bikinis for more than a decade , who for two years in a row fronted " Sports Illustrated 's " hallowed swimsuit issue .
But last month , paparazzi in Australia snapped these less than flattering pictures of Banks in a one-piece swimsuit , and the former cover girl found herself in the middle of a big fat scandal .
Tabloids ranging from " Star " magazine to " National Enquirer " printed the pictures and dubbed her , " America 's Next Top Waddle " .
But Banks , who currently hosts TV 's " America 's Next Top Model " and " The Tyra Banks Show" , fired back .
With a cover story in this week 's " People " magazine , in which she says , " It was such a strange meanness and rejoicing that people had when thinking that was what my body looked like . "
Banks also accused tabloids of distorting her weight gain .
GALINA ESPINOZA , " PEOPLE" MAGAZIN
The tabloids had said that she was near 200 pounds .
She told " People " magazine that she 's 161 pounds , and that since retiring from modeling in 2005 her weight has gone up and down like it does for a lot of women .
She has fluctuated between about 148 and 162 .
