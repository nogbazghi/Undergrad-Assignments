Mm .
-- " I 'm from the United States , bow down to me " or --
Or , um , you know , " I deserve preferential treatment " .
Right .
I 'm sort of an international person myself .
Oh , good .
Yeah .
So , um , I -- I see both sides 'cause I 've lived --
Okay .
-- outside America for a long time and I 've lived inside America for a long time .
Okay .
Actually eight years each to be exact .
Oh , okay , okay .
But , I mean , like , just looking -- you 're right , what you 're saying .
Like , there are Americans who are intelligent , they see what 's going on .
Like they 're -- they 're of the p - the point of view that , like , " Okay , this is who we are but there are also other people who have their other cultures and understandings and we should respect them for it " .
Uh-huh .
This is really funny 'cause when I first came here , like , a lot of people were all about , " Respect me , respect me , respect me , respect me" .
It was like a catchphrase .
Every single TV show h - had the words respect in it .
Uh-huh .
But , like , over here right now , the actions that they 're doing , that the government is saying and how the government is representative of the population , what they 're doing is not respectful .
No, I agree .
Ah , they 're kind of forcing , are n't they ?
Mm .
I mean , it 's just , I do n't know .
Like d- -- ah , well , spoils my point .
I mean , like , just coming from the outside and coming from the inside , there have been some Americans who are just like , " Oh , this is who I am" .
And 'specially , unfortunately before September eleventh that was on the rise .
Uh-huh .
They were totally there , like , going , " Oh , we do n't care , this , that " .
I mean , there 's sort of less now .
Right .
B- but with this , like , um , war being , like , successful and everything , I really hope people wo n't make the mistake of starting to -- start being big again .
Uh-huh .
Because those terrorist groups are still out there .
Although they 're not doing anything right now , they might get irked into doing something else .
You think they 've kind of gone underground ?
Oh yeah , definitely .
Yeah , yeah .
I mean , I do n't know what else they 're doing , nor do I want to , but --
Uh-huh .
-- they 're probably gonna wait 'til things have calmed down and everyone 's , like , going , " Nah , nah , nah " again , then they 'll probably --
Right .
-- find some other way of doing it .
Do you think nine eleven alerted us to the fact that these people are out -- are out there and hate the US as much as they do ?
Yes , but in the wrong way .
Yeah .
In the beginning it was -- it was like -- it was sort of decent in that we were all thinking , " Why ? "
