So , I do n't know .
This is all things that my father tells me .
I do n't know if it 's right or not but ...
Oh , it probably is .
My goodness .
It just gives us something to talk about though .
Yeah , yeah .
Do you -- do you think they 're going to be capable of , um , keeping peace over there themselves , if they 're --
Um , themselves ?
I mean , it depends on -- they have to have leaders , so it depends on who becomes the leader .
Yeah .
You know ?
It depends on -- on who -- if it 's -- if it 's just the guys that are there now , you know , that did n't have as much of a play -- that they could n't have had any play , you know .
I do n't know .
It 's like , you know , when -- when the President goes it 's the Vice President kind of thing .
And then the Secretary --
Right .
You know , like , I do n't know .
I do n't know how that would work --
Right , and w- --
-- unless the peop - --
We know that 's how it goes and everything .
And over there they have n't had anybody stand out but him .
Exactly .
Yeah .
So I do n't know if it 's something that the people would even be capable of -- of legislating --
Mhm .
-- because they do n't know any better .
They do n't know how -- they do n't know that the- -- that they can have rights and ... you know , and as far as history goes when other countries were liberated I do n't know , you know , when -- when , like when France was liberated from , ah , from Hitler , like what happened then ?
Like , who took over ?
Do you know any of that ?
No, I do n't .
Yeah , I do n't know .
I do n't know how that would work .
Yeah .
But , ah --
And I have n't heard anybody -- any name come up or anything stand out .
Yeah .
And I -- I think --
Just people right now --
-- most of their political prisoners were dead so that --
Yeah .
-- anybody that --
And a lot of people are just turning themselves in right now too .
Yeah .
So I do n't know -- I do n't know if it could even be one of them because they were -- they were with -- with Saddam Hussein for so long .
Yeah .
So ...
Yeah .
And they might --
-- want to take it back the way it was .
And they all seem to be related at that p - --
They 're all , like , cousins and brothers and in laws and --
Yeah .
-- it 's sick .
Yeah .
So , I do n't know .
Ah , yeah , I think that 's gonna be hard one .
