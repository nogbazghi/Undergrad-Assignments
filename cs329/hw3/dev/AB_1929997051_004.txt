I found this workbook very helpful .
I was in extreme pain from my back .
By following the excercises and keeping a journal like format , I was able to shift the focus from the physical to the psychological .
Not easy at all , but once you realize the pain is a cover up for what your not dealing with , the realization helps gradually ease the pain .
Dr. Schecter is very inciteful and provides a methodical approach to dealing with the elimination of pain .
You must be patient .
The MindBody connection is very strong and this book helps you uncover alot of what your mind masks .
After working with this workbook , I was pain free in about 6 weeks .
I highly recommend it as a tool to help refocus your thought patterns and eliminate your pain .
