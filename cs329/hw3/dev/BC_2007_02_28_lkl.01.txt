How is your client feeling ?
Well , she feels very disappointed about it .
But she 's very hopeful she 'll get a chance to hold her granddaughter .
John , we 've had you on a few times .
We 've always talked about Virgie .
I have n't asked you your -- your overall view of this whole thing .
Well , I 'll be happy to give you my view of this thing .
I think grandmothers are very important people .
Lots of Americans have been raised by grandmothers who have done a very good job and lots of people in the Bahamas have been raised by grandmothers .
And I think that there is a just god in this world .
And Virgie and I both pray to this god every night that he move the hearts of men and women to cause the right thing to happen .
And I believe ultimately that god will cause that to happen .
I think hearts will move and this young child will have a grandmother involved in her life .
So you 're saying you think we will find out who the real father is and the real father might be Larry and if it 's Larry , then she will have a grandmother ?
Yes , she 'll have a grandmother and she 'll have a father .
And that 's good .
That 's good to find this out .
I think -- I take my hat off to Larry Birkhead .
He 's doing the right thing .
And I wish Stern would do the right thing so the child could really know who is my father .
That child will wonder all her life who is my real father .
I mean that 's an important question to a child .
Courts can be frustratingly slow sometimes , right ?
Yes , they can be .
But I do n't believe that I -- I was in front of this judge in the Bahamas .
He 's a remarkable man .
KIN
Really ?
Yes , he is .
And I think he 'll run his court in the right way and he 'll get to the right decision .
I 'm trusting in that .
Thank you , John .
Thanks for all your cooperation with us .
You 're very welcome , Larry .
I apologize for the other night .
I was unable to do it ...
No problem .
... to do a better job for you .
You were great .
Thank you very much .
John O'Quinn .
In our next half hour , a friend of Anna 's who was in the house last night when Dannielynn 's grandmother saw her for the first time .
And we go to break with more of the " Access Hollywood " interview with Larry Birkhead about the day Anna Nicole died .
Where were you when you found out that either she had collapsed or that she had passed ?
I was sitting in the dentist 's chair with half of my mouth numb .
And at the dentist 's , they had televisions in front of you and this -- the headline said " Anna Nicole Collapses . "
And the first thing , I thought she was just -- that went through my head of course -- I was kind of numb , but I thought this might -- this is a joke because she had only one more day to pick out the date of the paternity .
