Staying on the topic of resistance , Rone Tempest ( Los Angeles Times ) reports on Sean O'Neill , Ronn Cantu , Mike Ergo , Jabbar Magruder and other California veterans speaking out against the illegal war who "are gaining a voice in opposition to American 's continued military presence in Iraq .
Recent antiwar demonstrations in Los Angeles , San Francisco and other cities have seen the first sizable contingents of veterans from the conflict . "
They are among the many members of Iraq Veterans Against the War which , Tempest notes , calls for : " the immediate withdrawal of all troops , improved treatment for soldiers upon their return and a national contribution to the reconstruction of postwar Iraq . "
Meanwhile the fatalities continue to mount .
CNN reports , " Fourteen U.S. soldiers and Marines were killed in Iraq during the past 72 hours , making April the sixth deadliest month of the Iraq war , according to the U.S. military . "
And the deadliest month for US service members this year with 104 fatalities ( Jan : 83 , Feb: 80 ; March : 81 ) .
Kim Gamel ( AP ) observes , " The killings of the Americans came as U.S. troops have been increasingly deployed on the streets of Baghdad and housed with Iraqi troops in joint security operations away from their heavily fortified bases , raising their vulnerability to attacks . "
Missy Comley Beattie ( writing at CounterPunch ) notes that the first 27 days of this month have seen the reported deaths of almost 1,400 Iraqis .
On Sunday , the British military announced : " It is with deep regret that the Ministry of Defence must confirm that a soldier from 2nd Battalion The Rifles ( 2 RIFLES ) has been killed in a small arms fire attack whilst on a routine patrol in the Al Ashar district , east of central Basra at about 0930hrs this morning , Sunday 29 April 2007 . "
This brought the total number of UK soldiers killed in the Iraq war since it began to 146 .
Michael Evans ( Times of London ) reports that 12 service members of the British Armed Forces have died this month which "makes this month the worst for fatalities since the campaign started . "
Staying with England , Steven Morris ( Guardian of London ) reports that Corporal Donald Payne has become England 's first " soldier ever to be convicted of a war crime [and ] was jailed for a year and dismissed from the army . "
BBC notes that Payne pleaded guilty of abusing Iraqis in 2003 .
Peter Graff ( Reuters ) reports that the sentence is one year in jail ( light for War Crimes ) and that Payne is " the only British soldier punished in the case of Baha Musa , an Iraqi hotel receptionist who died after suffering 93 separate injuries from beatings while in British custody in 2003 ."
In other legal news , CNN reports that " Lt .
Col . William H. Steele , former commander of the U.S. Army 's Camp Cropper , a detention facility for 'high-value ' detainees , will face an Article 32 hearing Monday after being accused of 'aiding the enemy ' by providing cell phones to Iraqi detainees . "
Monday is over in Baghdad (time difference ) .
Karin Brulliard ( Washington Post ) reports : " Only the barest outlines of the case against Steele emerged in Monday 's hearing , much of which was closed to reporters because it dealt with classified information .
Steele , dark-haired and square-jawed , sat next to his two appointed attorneys with his hands clasped , listening attentively . "
Brulliard notes that the Article 32 hearing is expected to last two to three days .
( The Article 32 hearing will determine whether or not the evidence is strong enough to warrant a court-martial . )
Finally , AP reported yesterday on Sean J. Maxwell , who was sented Saturday to 10 months and will receive a bad conduct discharage for returing " some two weeks late from a scheduled break " and for punching "his first sergeant in the face and head with a closed fist after returning to Kuwait on Feb. 7" .
