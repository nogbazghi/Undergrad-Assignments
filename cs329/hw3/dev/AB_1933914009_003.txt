Full disclosure : I did n't plan on reading this book ( frankly , I thought that she was just someone riding on the coattails of her famous husband ) but I saw Kim Kiyosaki at a fundraiser and was awed by how friendly and gracious she was .
I 'm glad I read the book -- Rich Woman is a solid read and very accessible for a beginning investor who wants to get some motivation and the basics .
Kim even read my mind about the coattails , acknowledging that husband Robert was the face of the company they built together and candidly sharing that this bothered her .
Refreshing !
I liked how she was able to balance her genuine emphasis on independence without sounding anti-men .
What I felt was missing was really not her fault : she has no kids so ca n't write like she does , but I do wonder how this story would have played out had kids been in the picture .
Could they live in their cars and bootstrap the business then ?
So , I recommend this book for good basics but someone , please write a money book for women with kids !
