Um , and then -- s - shoot , we live near a Navy base , so I 'm trying to figure out what else .
Really ?
But there were , um , there are people coming home , b - but they 're -- they 're going to be on a rotation for a while and it -- I kind of feel sorry for all the people who were forward deployed because they 're going to be out a lot more than I think they had planned to be .
Yeah .
Yeah , but , um , it 's k - --
M- -- we were kind of scared .
My son in law 's in the -- in the , um , Reserves .
Mhm .
And he -- he was , you know , we were afraid he was going to get called up , 'cause he 's got young children too .
Right .
And , uh , and I was just , ah ... really concerned about , uh , him going , because when he went to boot camp , his son was n't even e- eighteen months old --
Yeah .
-- and he just -- he would not talk , you know , he just -- it -- it affected him so much that he refused to even try to talk --
Uh-oh .
-- and , um , he still -- his speech -- he 's five now and his speech is n't normal .
Yeah .
Now -- now there -- there might be something wrong with him , but -- but -- and then on top of it , Terry got hurt .
Oh , that 's hard for a kid to understand .
And -- yeah , and so , um , he 's got -- he hurt his back , so I do n't think they will take him anyway , but we 're kind of glad to see it spe- w- winding down .
Oh .
You know ?
Yeah , I do n't know --
So --
-- my brother 's a Reserve .
He got called up , but he works -- they called him up to take a place in Penalton so somebody else could go , and he was kind of raring to go , he was , like , you know , wanted to be over there --
Yeah .
-- but of course his wife 's there , so that might have do -- make some difference , but --
Oh yeah , I 'm sure .
Yeah , but , um --
Yeah , it 's the separation from family that 's hard .
Terry would go , he would n't , you know , he would n't question it --
Mhm .
-- but it 's just , you know , 'cause of the kids , but --
Yeah .
-- 'cause that 's what he signed up for , and then he got hurt and he 's got this thing wrong with his back now .
I c - -- I do n't even know how he 's working .
Oh .
But , um --
That 's rough , that 's rough .
Well , uh , like you said though , it did have to be done , you know --
Yeah , I think so , I think so .
-- and -- and it 's got to be --
