It freaked me out .
I thought this woman was trying to steal my identity because she came up and said do you mind if I just check you out here and I can e-mail you the receipt .
No, you freak .
You 're not part of the Internet generation , are you ?
Clearly this is working because they 've made the Apple Store a destination .
I loved it .
It was near my old apartment .
You feel cool .
You feel like they care about you .
The cool thing about that too is they collect your e-mail address right there on the spot because they e-mail you a receipt .
Not only are they collecting e-mail addresses , but you get a receipt an hour later and you 're sort of impressed by the whole experience .
Let 's take another listen to someone else we talked to on the street about what bothers them .
UNIDENTIFIED MAL
There have been situations when I 'm at a restaurant and if it takes too long or service is bad I 'll just walk out immediately .
Yes .
The dining out is about the service experience as much as it is about the food .
If you do n't get both right you 're toast as a restaurant chain .
One that firings it out on both levels is cheesecake factory .
If you can spare the calories , not only are waistlines growing quickly , but they 're growing and they manage to keep this friendly , fun , engaging service no matter how busy their restaurants are .
They 're often busy .
This is quite an interesting value proposition because you always have to wait .
They do n't take reservations .
But they tell you how long you have to wait and it 's true .
They give you the little electronic thing that lights up and buzzes .
And with a smile and in good spirit and it 's a really simple thing .
Companies that fill their organization with happy people have happy customers .
I took someone on a date there .
You took someone on a date there ?
You know why ?
Because the value proposition at the cheesecake factory is it feels like a much bigger experience .
You know the average check there is $ 16 bucks .
Did you talk to her about value propositions ?
I did .
That 's how I got a second date .
OK .
Moving on .
Let 's listen to one more person .
When you 're making a phone call and you have a simple question to ask , it would be great to have someone answer the question and not have to go throw a whole rigmarole to get to a person .
That 's got to be the top of everyone 's list .
My favorite is when you put in your information and then the person says will you tell me your information .
You have to be a personal detective , for my bank it 's pound , seven , sir , star and for the airline it 's zero , zero , six , seven and companies are spending billions of dollars to it 's automate their support .
Have you heard an executive saying we 'll get better by listening to the voice of the customer ?
Memo to the boss , answer the phone , right ?
It 's absolutely aggravating .
