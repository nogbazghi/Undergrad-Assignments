We ask at the post office .
OK .
We 're looking for Elsie Jessop .
You do n't know anything about her ?
We do n't .
... familiar name to me .
OK .
We ask at the grocery store .
We 're trying to find Elsie Jessop .
Do you know Elsie Jessop ?
The store manager does n't want us there .
( INAUDIBLE ) do n't need to talk .
I will call the officers and have you removed .
We 're " Keeping Them Honest , " so we get in our car and explore other parts of Jeffs ' kingdom .
We go to the house where Johnny Jessop was raised by his mom .
A new family now lives there , but is not at home .
A neighbor across the street surprises us by talking , saying she does know Elsie and her son , Johnny .
He 's one of the " Lost Boys " who 's filed suit to try to find out where she is .
You 've no idea .
You have n't seen her ?
No.
Not that I can recollect .
One woman is even more talkative .
Do you know Elsie Jessop ?
I knew her from her son .
We 're looking for her , because her son is looking for her .
Yes , I know her son .
I do n't know where she is right now .
Johnny , who wants nothing to do with the church or polygamy , is not surprised we found nothing .
He 's gone back looking himself .
It 's been pretty hard .
I do n't really know how I got through it , but I did .
Johnny may very well win his lawsuit .
But even if a judge orders Warren Jeffs to talk , there 's no way to physically force Jeffs to do so if he does n't want to .
And Johnny , who now has a job and hopes to get a GED someday , knows that .
If you do get to see your mom , and I sure hope you do ... JESSO
Sure .
... what 's the first thing you want to do ?
Give her a big hug and tell her how much I love her .
What has Johnny been doing all these years since being kicked out ?
The answer is quite startling and depressing .
Actually , for some of the years , Johnny just lived with other kids , other " Lost Boys " , no adult supervision .
And he was basically squatting in houses .
Some of the time he spent with older siblings but never his mother .
There were actually , Anderson , two court case in which a judge said that Johnny had to go back to his mother .
His mother was at the court .
But when he came back here to Hilldale , Utah , they said they did n't want him , and Johnny left again .
The last two years have been better for him .
A foundation in Salt Lake City 300 miles north of here takes in Lost Boys , gives them free room and board , and that 's where Johnny 's been living the last couple of years .
What are Warren Jeffs ' lawyers saying about this lawsuit ?
Well , it 's not clear how they feel .
It 's also not clear who will be representing him in this case .
His criminal lawyers may not represent him in this civil suit .
We called the criminal lawyers , and there was no comment coming from them about this case .
