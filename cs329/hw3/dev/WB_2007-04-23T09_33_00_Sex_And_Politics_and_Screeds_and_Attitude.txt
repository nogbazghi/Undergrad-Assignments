Despiate Atta 's disdain , foreign press , such as the BBC , is much more likely to note the wall is a US project while domestic press tries to dance around the issue ( hard to do when the nominal prime minister has called for the construction to cease and it continues ) .
The BBC notes that the " US military , which is behind the project " and that 's pretty clear as is the noting of the fact that the US military is working around the clock [" US troops , protected by heavily-armed vehicles , have been working at night to build the 3.6m ( 12ft ) wall . " ]
which sort of exposes the lie that the lack of electricity , potable water , et al could n't be fixed because ( a ) it takes time and ( b ) it 's just so darn dangerous .
Clearly , when the US administration wants something , the US military does it .
So what 's going on ?
The wall is n't about safety for Iraqis .
It 's about walling them in .
The biometric devices were used in Falluja as well ( after the November 2004 slaughter of Falluja reduced the modern city to rubble and turned inhabitants into refugees -- many of whom still live in tent cities to this day ) .
Those devices have n't done a damn thing to stop the violence there .
As Amy Goodman ( Democracy Now ! ) noted today , " In Fallujah , the chair of the City Council was assassinated on Saturday .
Sami Abdul-Amir al-Jumaili is the fourth chair of the Fallujah city council to be killed in the past 14 months .
He took the job a month ago . "
China 's People 's Daily has photos of the funeral and notes that Abdul-Amir al-Jumaili "was gunned down . . .
as he was walking outside his home in central Falluja" .
Last week , the deadliest day in Iraq took place ( Wednesday ) with very little attention .
Certainly it received not even half the attention that the Virginia Tech shootings ( last Monday ) did .
This is Naomi Klein :
When I was twenty-three , I had my first media job as a copy editor at a newspaper .
The newspaper closed at 11 P.M. , but two people stayed until 1 A.M. in case a news story broke that was so significant it was worth reopening the front page .
On the first night that it was my turn to stay late , a tornado in a southern U.S. state killed three people , and the senior editor on duty decided to reopen the front page .
On my second night , I read on the wires that 114 people had just been killed in Afghanistan , so I dutifully flagged down the senior editor .
Remember , I was young , and it seemed to me that if three people warranted reopening the front page , then 114 people would surely classify as a major news event .
I will never forget what the editor told me .
" Do n't worry , " he said , " those people kill each other all the time . "
Since Septemeber 11 , I 've been thinking again about that incident , about how we in the media participate in a process that confirms and reconfirms the idea that death and murder are tragic , extraordinary and intolerable in some places and banal , ordinary , unavoidable , even expected in others .
