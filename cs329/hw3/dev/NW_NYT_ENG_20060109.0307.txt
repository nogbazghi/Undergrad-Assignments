The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office plans to announce Tuesday that
it will cooperate with open-source software developers on three initiatives
that it says will improve the quality of software patents .
The patent office has come under increasing pressure in recent years
from critics who contend that it issues patents without adequate
investigation of earlier inventions .
As a result , conflicts over published
patents have loosed an avalanche of intellectual property litigation .
At a meeting last month with companies and organizations that support
open-source software ( software that can be distributed and modified freely ) ,
including IBM , Red Hat , Novell and some universities , officials of
the patent office discussed how to give patent examiners access
to better information and other ways to issue higher-quality patents .
Two of the initiatives would rely on recently developed Internet technologies .
An open patent review program would set up a system
on the patent office Web site where visitors could submit
search criteria and subscribe to electronic alerts about patent applications
in specific areas .
The third initiative is focused on the creation of a patent
quality index that would serve as a tool for patent
applicants to use in writing their applications .
It is based
on work done by R. Polk Wagner , an intellectual property
expert at the University of Pennsylvania .
" This is a great example of how the patent office can
reach out to the community and how they can help
us where we have difficulty getting prior art , " said John
J.
Doll , the commissioner for patents .
The patent office has held similar discussions with other technology industries
including biotechnology , nanotechnology and semiconductors , he said .
The open-source project , being led by IBM , aims to build an
automated system for creating a series of categories to organize
software written by open-source programmers .
The system would then be
made available to help patent examiners search for earlier examples
in patent applications .
Doll said that Google had participated in the discussions and it
was possible that its search technology would be used in
the project .
Jim Stalling , vice president for intellectual property and standards at IBM ,
said , " We think that this initiative will lead to greater
certainty in the patent system . "
He added that any improvement
in the general quality of patents would lower the costs
of defending patents , and that money could again be focused
on financing research and development .
One frequent critic of the patent system , Gregory Aharonian , publisher of
The Internet Patent News Service , said it was unlikely that
the new initiatives would have a significant impact , because the
patent office was not able to deal efficiently with the
information it already had .
" If the patent office ca n't figure out how to use the
resources they already have , " he said , "what is the point ? "
Diane Peters , general counsel for the Open Source Development Laboratories , a
corporate consortium backed by Linux supporters , said that if the
initiatives were successful it might lead the patent office to
issue fewer but higher-quality patents .
Separately , the patent office plans to announce Tuesday that IBM once
again topped the list of private-sector patent recipients in 2005 .
The company received 2,941 patents last year , compared with 3,248
patents in 2004 .
