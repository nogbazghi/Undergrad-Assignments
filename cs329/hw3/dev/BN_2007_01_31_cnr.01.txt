Listening , listening long to the opening bell on this very day where the president will be at this very area a little bit later on today giving a report on the economy .
But right now just to let you know , we are looking at some numbers here today .
Things ended up about 12,523 yesterday .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average , that was up by about 32 points or so .
So we 'll be continuing to watch that and , of course , bringing you the president 's remarks .
At least some of them when they happen a little bit later on today .
And among our top stories this morning , a terrifying potential crime broken up in a counterterrorism raid today .
That 's how British police are characterizing the arrest of eight suspects captured in raids this morning in Birmingham , England .
A security source tells CNN the plot , if carried out , would have involved a chilling new tactic .
The source says the suspects planned to kidnap a British Muslim soldier serving in Afghanistan .
He was to be tortured and beheaded with the grisly scene playing out on the Internet .
One of the major problems that they 've got in their hearts and minds campaign are the Muslims who exercise their freedom of choice to join the British army or the security services or the police .
And if they can try and make an example of people like that by doing a public execution , that is a dreadful form of terrorism that impacts on an individual 's right to make freedom of choice .
And of course these extremists do n't want freedom of choice .
I mean really they just want an utter control over the hearts and minds and really it 's a manifestation of that extremism that we 're seeing now .
We 've got live coverage of a news conference by British police coming up at the top of the hour right here on CNN.
