Yesterday was a long day .
Up at 4:30AM for a flight down to LA .
A day of meetings then back on a plane to get home by 10:30PM.
Too wired to sleep and nothing on TV but people talking about Michael Vick .
Time to grab a book .
I figured that I would read a couple of chapters then off to bed .
A couple of hours later and the book was finished .
It is not a surprise that it only took a couple of hours , the book is barely over 120 pages .
The surprise is I finished it before going to bed .
I was that tired and it was that good .
This is an easy book to read , and it is a good story , but at 120 pages , I do not think it will teach you how to run a business .
It does make you think about the business side of business .
There are two really good things in this book , you have to love business nearly as much as you love the business you are in and do n't waste money on advertising .
The author 's depiction of advertising sales people is classic .
" Of course this Ad will help your business , you just have to keep advertising until people recognize your name . "
Right , but do you guarantee this will bring in customers ?
" We ca n't do that , of course .
How do we know why someone came in ?
But , just keep running the ad and I 'm sure it will work . "
I have been there often .
The danger after reading it is that you may conclude that you should never advertise .
Not true .
Advertising may or may not be great for your business .
Maybe the kind of advertising you are doing is not right .
I ran a business where we were spending $ 15,000 a month on ads .
How did we know what ads worked ?
We asked .
We kept track of which ads worked and which did n't .
We changed what the ads said .
We changed where they ran .
We changed when they ran .
And , we asked customers how they found us and noted how much they spent .
All of this data helped show that the $ 5000 we were spending a month in yellow page ads was wasting lots of money and the $ 3000 a month we spent in Val Pak coupons was bringing in 50 % of our business .
The other 50 % came from repeat , word of mouth , and the rest of the $ 15000 we spent on other types of ads .
Because we asked , we started running much smaller ads in Yellow Pages and moving that money to send out more Val Pak ads .
Sales increased .
We then set aside some of the budget to experiment with .
We used it to try all kinds of things .
Those that worked earned the right to continue , those that did n't , well let 's just say Edison had a lot of failures too .
There are many good books on advertising out there , Much thicker than this wonderful novel .
I like Dan Kennedy 's stuff for how to test and write copy .
The guerrilla marketing series is also very good .
So why 5 stars ?
Because this book does a great job at what it does .
It is not trying to be a complete business book .
It does a great job in showing you that there is a difference between having a hobby that you are good at and turning it into a business .
The difference is you have to spend as much or more time doing the business stuff , as you spend on the fun stuff .
And if you do not excel at the business side , there will be a lot of pain .
