Remember when you were out holiday shopping three
weeks ago and on a whim decided to buy that
new $ 400 coat ?
Without enough money in your checking account , you whipped out your
credit card and walked out of the store with a
warm glow about you .
Well , now it 's time to pay for that buying spree , plus
whatever else you added to your cards during the holidays .
If you 're among the millions who threw caution -- and their
budgets -- to the wind and spent more money than
they had intended , those warm and fuzzy holiday feelings soon
will be turning into a cold chill as those credit
card bills arrive in the mail .
Donald Rehorn of ByDesign Financial Solutions in Sacramento warns that not
only are consumers facing larger bills following the holidays , but
some will have to pay more than they have in
the past .
Rehorn says new regulations taking effect this year require larger minimum
credit card payments at the same time that higher fuel
costs are taking more money out of pocketbooks .
" The new regulations requiring an increase in the minimum credit card
payments may hit those who can least afford it , " he
says .
Judging from a recent decline in consumer borrowing , perhaps some consumers
are anticipating the change .
Consumer credit dropped by an annual
rate of 4.7 percent in October and then dipped another
0.4
percent in November , according to the Federal Reserve .
Borrowers should expect to experience a more aggressive collection environment , Rehorn
warns .
" The new bankruptcy regulations that went into effect last year are
perceived to make it more difficult to file .
More aggressive
creditors are using that perception to pressure consumers to pay
up , and that in turn puts more pressure on those
who can least afford a major change in spending , " says
Rehorn , whose company was formerly known as Consumer Credit Counseling
Service of the Sacramento Valley .
With the start of the new year , Jennifer Openshaw , chief executive
of Openshaw 's Family Financial Network in Los Angeles , says it 's
a good time to focus on your debts .
" Your goal , " she says " should be to wipe out all of
your holiday credit card debts by March .
" Remember , if you charge $ 1,000 and only make the minimum payments ,
you 'll pay on that for months and months and rack
up an additional $ 400 in interest charges . "
But if you pay it off by March , it will only
cost you $ 50 in interest charges , Openshaw adds .
Sacramento certified financial planner Laura Pajak advises consumers to start the
year by putting a price tag on their lifestyle .
" Once you 've created that budget , you can see where you will
have to make changes to find the money to pay
off your credit card debts , " she says .
Then you have to set a realistic timetable to pay off
the debt , she adds .
" You might find that you have to put a temporary moratorium
on going to Starbucks .
Instead of three trips a week ,
you might have to cut back to once a month . "
Make a sprint out of paying off your debt , she advises .
" Go lean and mean for four months and pay it
all off . "
Rehorn , whose nonprofit company has been counseling Sacramento Valley residents for
more than 40 years , says there are several ways to
reduce your debts and improve your overall financial health .
The first step , he says , is to " create your own get-out-of-debt
plan .
That starts with a family meeting to bring spending
under control and to create a plan that involves every
member of the family . "
If you 're going to get out of debt , he says , you
need to write down your financial goals and be specific .
" Just make sure everyone in your household is on the
same page , " Rehorn says .
Once you determine how much you spend on basic living costs ,
then you 'll begin to see how much you have to
allocate to your debt .
Obviously , he says , the more money
you can allocate to your debt , the better off you
will be .
At the same time , he notes , "you have to stop digging
your pile of debt any deeper .
If you are already
in debt , stop charging altogether , " he says .
" Pay only with
cash , check or debit card . "
Many consumers , Rehorn says , have run up debts on multiple credit
cards .
He recommends that consumers pay off the smallest credit card balance
first .
" Sure , it 's wise to pay off the highest-balance card
first , but I believe that success builds success and there
is great accomplishment in paying of a credit card . "
Since most people did n't end up with a pile of debts
instantaneously , they wo n't be able to wipe out that debt
all at once .
You 've got to take it a step
at a time , and what better time to start than
right now ?
