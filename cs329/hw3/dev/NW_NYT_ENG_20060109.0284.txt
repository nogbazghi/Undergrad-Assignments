UNC-Chapel Hill has been dubbed the best education
value in the land among U.S. public , four-year universities by
a financial magazine .
The ranking , released today by Kiplinger 's Personal Finance , means UNC-CH has
remained at the top position since the magazine started the
ranking in 1998 -- even though tuition and fees have
more than doubled for in-state students during the same period .
Still , Kiplinger 's says , UNC-CH offers " the best combination of high-quality academics
and affordable costs . "
Other North Carolina public universities on the
list were N.C .
State University ( 28 ) , UNC-Wilmington ( 32 ) , Appalachian State
University ( 33 ) and UNC-Asheville ( 50 ) .
The magazine considered indicators of academic quality , including SAT scores and
graduation rates .
Then it ranked each school based on cost
and financial aid .
This year at UNC-CH , North Carolinians pay about $ 4,600 in tuition
and fees , and out-of-state students pay $ 18,400 .
Room and board
add about $ 7,000 .
Nationally , in-state students at four-year , public universities spend an average of
$ 5,491 for tuition and fees , and $ 12,127 in all , counting
room and board , according to the College Board .
UNC system students likely will pay more in the next academic
year .
The system governing board will consider tuition and fee
increases in the next two months .
UNC-CH Chancellor James Moeser
said Monday that the university 's financial-aid policies have helped lessen
the blow of tuition increases .
" Tuition notwithstanding , we 've made it more affordable than three or even
five years ago , " Moeser said .
In 2004 , the university started the Carolina Covenant , which guarantees a
free education to the poorest students , who agree to work
on campus as much as 12 hours a week .
The
covenant program covered about 10 percent of the freshman class
this year .
Last year , the university introduced new merit scholarships to help recruit
talented students .
And in recent years , the legislature has set
money aside for financially needy students in the UNC system .
'GATED' COMMUNITIES
Still , some critics say UNC-CH is increasingly elite .
Tom Mortenson , an independent analyst of higher education policy , put UNC-CH
at 19th on his recent ranking of 50 public universities
that he calls "gated communities of higher education . "
NCSU was
31st on that list .
He cited the fact that 14.5 percent of undergraduates at UNC-CH
in 2003-2004 received Pell Grants , federal financial aid for poor
students .
" From my perspective , this is an extremely exclusive , publicly financed gated
community , and I think it 's an inappropriate role for a
state flagship university to play , " said Mortenson , a senior scholar
at the Pell Institute for the Study of Opportunity in
Higher Education .
Because of UNC-CH 's competitive admissions standards , it is generally attended by
students who are born into affluence , Mortenson said .
That means
that taxpayers end up subsidizing the education of students who
would go to college anyway , he added .
North Carolina 's private universities made Mortenson 's list of 50 private "gated
communities , " with Davidson College seventh , Wake Forest University 12th , Elon
University 27th , and Duke University 46th .
Davidson officials took issue with the ranking , which identified 7.2 percent
of students as Pell Grant recipients .
" That is so skewed , " said Kathleen Stevenson , senior associate dean of
admission and financial aid .
" That sort of thing is only
one measure of affordability . "
Stevenson said one-third of Davidson students receive financial aid .
This year ,
Davidson 's tuition is about $ 28,600 .
Room and board bring the
total cost to about $ 36,800 .
