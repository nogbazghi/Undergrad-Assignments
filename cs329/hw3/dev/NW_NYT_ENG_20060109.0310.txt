Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , speaking through lips swollen
from a motorcycle accident a day earlier , announced Monday that
the budget plan he 'll unveil today will include $ 72.2 million
to increase enrollment in Medi-Cal and Healthy Families programs .
The governor said the money would be part of a $ 1.2
billion increase in health and human services spending he 'll include
in his $ 116 billion budget proposal .
" There are more than 400,000 children that are eligible for the
Healthy Families program , and they are not enrolled yet , " he
said at a clinic for women and children .
" This is
unacceptable . "
He said the money would be spent on increasing public awareness
and simplifying the process for enrolling and remaining in the
low-cost and no-cost health insurance programs for children from low-income
families .
Healthcare consumer advocates called the governor 's proposal a "nice first step "
but criticized Schwarzenegger for falling short of campaign promises to
provide insurance for all the state 's nearly 900,000 uninsured children .
" For a governor with big ideas , his health proposals have been
fairly small steps , " said Anthony Wright , Health Access executive director .
Schwarzenegger said expansion of the program was " something to look into ,
but let 's first find the 400,000 and make sure that
we sign everyone up . "
Assemblyman John Laird , D-Santa Cruz and Assembly budget committee chairman , urged
the governor to move ahead with expanding the program , saying
it would cost less than $ 300 million to provide coverage
to all the state 's uninsured children .
" For a relatively small amount of money in the budget , we
could be taking a big step that would actually provide
savings over time , because kids will actually be getting care , "
Laird said .
Robert Ross , California Endowment president and chief executive officer , said investing
in children 's health is just as important to the state 's
future as the highways , school buildings and other public works
for which the governor proposed spending $ 222 billion over the
next decade .
" The governor outlined an aggressive and bold vision for addressing the
infrastructure needs of this state , " Ross said .
" We are of
the opinion that health care and investing in health care
represents a portion of that infrastructure . "
But the governor 's vetoed a measure last year , Assembly Bill 772 ,
to expand enrollment in public health insurance programs , saying it
was financially unworkable .
Children 's advocates are part of a coalition preparing petitions to fund
children 's insurance and other health programs with an additional $ 2.60-per-pack
tobacco tax .
Schwarzenegger declined to take a position on their
proposal Monday , saying he would wait to see if it
qualifies for the ballot .
With state revenues on the rise , the governor is expected to
unveil a markedly different budget today than the relatively austere
spending plans of the last two years .
He 's already previewed
budget increases of $ 4 billion for education , and he 's expected
to propose early repayment of some bonds used to balance
the state 's budget in 2004 .
But the $ 1.2 billion proposed increase in health and human services
spending he announced on Monday represents only about a 4
percent increase in the $ 27 billion being spent this year
on those programs , and it includes routine adjustments for inflation
in huge programs like Medi-Cal , the state 's insurance for the
poor .
It 's also $ 800 million less than the increase he
proposed for those programs last year .

Advocates for welfare recipients said they 're expecting the governor to propose
cuts in social services , including welfare .
" We are anticipating bad news in the budget , " said Mike Herald ,
a Western Center on Law and Poverty attorney .
While others fretted about potential cuts , Treasurer Phil Angelides held a
press conference Monday to call for spending more on public
works than the $ 222 billion the governor proposed .
" The governor 's plan does not increase our rate of infrastructure investment , "
the Democratic gubernatorial candidate said .
" It 's what we were going
to do anyway , wrapped in a nice bow in a
big package , with a nice soundstage behind it . "
Angelides said he would raise taxes on California 's highest earners and
" close corporate tax loopholes " to help finance his improvements plan .
He noted that Schwarzenegger 's plan includes more than $ 100.8 billion already
set aside for public improvements , and the $ 68 billion in
bonds the governor proposed over the next two elections is
similar to what voters have been willing to spend the
past five years .
Angelides also criticized the governor 's proposed constitutional amendment , which would limit
to 6 percent the ratio between annual debt service and
General Fund revenues .
He called the amendment a "political gimmick " to make his " conservative
base ... feel better about what he 's doing . "
Schwarzenegger said he expected an "endless amount of debate " over his
proposals but said the "mood " in Sacramento is better this
year than last year .
" The thing is just not to let politics get in the
way and let the election year get in the way , "
he said .
" The thing is just to get beyond that . "
