It does seem like that 's --
This is nothing but testosterone .
-- where a lot of the problems come from .
Nothing but testosterone .
Yeah .
You know ?
But my n-
Seems like most wars have to do with that .
Yeah .
I- um , not both but all .
You know ?
Yeah , that 's true .
" No , mine is bigger let me show you " .
Okay , well , we 're over that , you know .
I 'm so over that by now .
Yeah , it makes me feel very dis - um , disconnected from the government just 'cause I -- I ca n't understand why you would have to go to war all the time , you know ?
W- wh - why would we make -- why would we make , ah , decisions to , you know , have people I know or people my age go die for something I just do n't even care about ?
I mean --
Mm , I mean , I understand that this man , you know , soon as somebody says something against him he imprisons them and -- but , you know , how about this , how about we teach the people over there who want to , to rise up against him , you know ?
Instead of us doing it , why do n't we let the people handle it their selves , those that want to do it ?
Yeah .
Yeah .
And it seems -- I read somewhere that , um , something like eighty five percent of Americans now believe , mistakenly , but they believe that Iraq had something to do with the World Trade Center .
Which it just kind of shocked me 'cause , I mean , I 'm not saying they 're not bad people but a - but , you know , that was n't them .
But everything thinks , you know , we 're getting them back now for the World Trade Center .
Well , that 's not the right people .
It was n't Saddam Hussein .
Those people -- they would n't even like Sadda - -- the -- Osama bin Laden would n't like Saddam Hussein because Saddam Hussein does n't believe in fundamentalist --
No
-- religious practice .
Yeah , there 's -- I mean , two different , um , sects and , I mean , you know --
That would be like saying the -- the Pope , ah -- Po- -- the Pope is on the side of , I do n't know , a Pentecostal .
Yeah .
You know ?
Just --
Kind of not the same thing .
Yeah , they 're both Christians but ...
But yeah , kind of not the same thing .
I do n't know .
This is -- is , um , tough to say but I know one thing about it , I 'm sick of everybody else hating us because of the Middle East .
Yeah .
You know ?
I mean , that gets old real fast too .
When you go over-
Where are you ?
I 'm in Georgia .
Oh , me too , I 'm in Atlanta .
Oh , okay .
I 'm in Snow Mountain .
