The markings are everywhere .
Further up the mountain , the unit checks out a destroyed bunker position .
U.S. helicopters passing over this mountain noticed this bunker .
There were fighters inside .
They fired rockets , later called in an air strike .
It 's been destroyed now .
But what remains , you can see is pretty well built .
These large stones were used to create like a supporting wall .
Over here there 's some heavy timbers which were probably used to build the roof of the bunker .
Soldiers say as many as 10 or 15 fighters could have used this bunker at any one time .
From the bunkers ' firing position , there is a direct line of sight to Captain Dye 's base , but there 's no sign enemy fighters have been here recently .
On the way back down , however , the soldiers get some troubling news .
The unit has just received some intelligence .
And we ca n't tell you how they received it , but it indicates that there may be fighters in this area .
It could mean an ambush , could be just talk , it could be nothing at all .
It just means that the soldiers have to be extra vigilant as they head back down the mountain .
What do you look for ?
Movement , personnel .
Anybody gathering in a spot that looks odd .
People trying to hide in the tree line , that sort of thing .
Spotters .
Usually the locals do n't go up into these hills .
If you see someone sitting on them , that 's a spotter .
On this patrol , however , there are no spotters , no ambush after all .
Captain Dye and his men head safely back to base .
One mission down , countless more to go .
You know , I have a family .
All of these guys have families .
We 're out here fighting so that we do n't have to do this at home , so that our families can stay safe and that makes you feel good .
It makes you feel like you 're doing something .
It is not just members of the Taliban that U.S. forces are fighting .
They are also facing al Qaeda insurgents , Uzbeks ( ph ) and Chechens ( ph ) , foreign terrorists , jihadists who have come here to conduct what they consider to be holy war .
When we come back , some of the propaganda that al Qaeda is putting out , showing what they say is a foreign fighter about to commit a suicide bomb attack here in Afghanistan .
We 'll have that when " Afghanistan : The Unfinished War " continues .
