You have deliberately misquoted Barack Obama .
He never said that he attended a Madrasa .
Why ?
Because he did n't .
He attended a predominantly Muslim public school .
Why ?
Because he was in a predominately Muslim country .
That is not a Madrasa .
Get your facts straight before you repeat such garbage .
