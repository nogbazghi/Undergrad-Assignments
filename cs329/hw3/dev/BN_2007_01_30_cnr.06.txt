Well , it has been a cockpit controversy for ages : able - bodied , clear-eyed , quick-witted airline pilots forced to retire at the age of 60 .
Now , the FAA has been considering whether to let older pilots keep their wings a while longer .
Today , we get a decision .
Joining us from Washington with details , Brianna Keilar .
Hi , Brianna .
Hi there , Don .
That age 60 rule has been the rule since 1959 , but , today , a proposal from the FAA to up that mandatory retirement age for commercial airline pilots to 65 .
Now , there is a condition here .
If one of the pilots in a cockpit is between 60 and 65 , the other pilot would have to be younger than 60 .
Historically , people who have opposed increasing this mandatory retirement age have said they 're concerned that , as pilots get older , they could make mistakes , and that those mistakes could potentially be disastrous .
But the FAA says new data refutes those concerns .
And today , when the FAA head Marion Blakey announced this new proposal , she cited safety as her reasoning for this change .
The fact of the matter is that there 's a heck of a lot of experience behind those captain 's stripes , and we should n't have to lose it as early as we do these days .
I want our older pilots to be around to help younger pilots rising up through the ranks .
A pilot can learn a lot by seeing how the experienced vet handles a situation they may have only seen in simulation .
Critics of this rule change , some of them pilots ' unions , say this is n't just about safety , it 's also about the bottom line .
And that is really the case on both sides of the debate .
Younger pilots , pilots who may have been laid off , have traditionally supported this cap at age 60 because that creates more opportunities for them as the older pilots are aged out .
But now there 's really a more vocal group .
And this is those veteran pilots who , as some of these larger airlines have declared bankruptcy , have pretty much seen their pensions evaporate .
So this would give them five more years of paychecks .
There is a sign that some critics could be changing their tune .
ALPA , which is the Airline Pilots ' Association -- it 's the largest union for pilots in the entire world -- has historically opposed this increase in the mandatory retirement age .
Officially , that 's still their line .
But union members did elect a president very recently .
He took office this month who personally supports this increase in age .
So , perhaps a sign there that they 're willing to follow the FAA 's lead on this -- Don .
Yes , and it 's been kind of a thorny issue for them for years .
Brianna , tell us how long will this take before it 's adopted ?
It seems like this rule will take quite a while before it 's adopted .
Today , Marion Blakey , head of the FAA , said she estimates it could be 18 months to two years or maybe even longer than that .
It 's really sort of a long process that this would go through .
