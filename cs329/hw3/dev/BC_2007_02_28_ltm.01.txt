Let 's start with the numbers that are already coming in from overseas .
Another down day for most Asian markets , but brighter news in China .
All of it , of course , is affecting Wall Street today .
Everybody is wondering if the Dow is going to rebound from Tuesday 's dramatic 416-point drop .
Encouraged by the Chinese stock market that came back today from its dramatic slide .
Going to be watching it all day for you .
Got live reports coming up from Wall Street , from Beijing , and from Hong Kong this morning as well -- Miles .
A reunion in Korea to tell you about this morning for Olympic skier Toby Dawson .
Remember him ?
He 's 29 years old .
He won the bronze medal in the 2006 games in Turin .
He was raised by adoptive parents who were ski instructors in Colorado .
Dawson traveled halfway around the world to try to find his biological father .
And CNN 's Sohn Jie-ae has our story .
SOHN JIE-AE , CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over ) : The resemblance between father and son is uncanny , but apparently not good enough .
More than 25 years ago , Kim Jae-su lost his 3-year-old son Pumtuk ( ph ) in a crowded South Korean market and was never able to find him again .
Until now .
Through his tears , Kim keeps saying , " I 'm sorry . "
His biological son , now named Toby Dawson , is a 29-year-old U.S. citizen and a U.S. Olympic skier .
( SPEAKING KOREAN ) -- which I believe means I have been waiting a long time .
And I told him that I was happy to be able to meet him and that -- that he was -- that he did n't need to cry , and to be strong , because this should be a happy day .
