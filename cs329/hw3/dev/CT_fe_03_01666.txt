Um , I -- I was on one of their groups a while back .
If you look up groups dot Yahoo dot com --
Uh-huh .
And get to the homepage of the groups and put in home school fleamail , F.L.E.A.M.
Uh-huh .
Ah , F.L.E.A.M.A.I.L. There 's , like , ah groups and they 're broken down from miscellaneous , first , you know , ah , primary school , um , high school , middle school .
Uh-huh .
And , ah , I mean , there 's a lot of people that do that now instead of eBay because they do n't have to worry about the fee .
Yeah , well --
And --
-- eBay charges thirty cents to list and then they get five percent of the listing and -- or what you sell , I mean , and ...
And this way there 's also , like , bad trader lists .
If you join -- if you look at the list you 'll find it where there 's a few people that , you know , have to be -- ah , they either say they 're selling something they do n't have --
Oh , really ?
Yeah .
Or they , um , do n't e- do n't ever buy .
And what happens is if people do th - do bad , they get -- we have our own eBay feedback system sort of .
Oh .
You know , where people get their name and email gets posted and --
Oh , cool .
So that can be a good deal because there 's so many people that -- if you find it at yard sales , ah , so many people want it and --
Oh , that 's true .
What -- what , um , books do you use ?
Ah , I 'm using Saxon Math .
Ah , I just sold a Saxon Math book .
Really ?
I 've got k - I got k - kindergarten and I 've got to get the first grade one , she 's ready to go into that .
But my mom and I are going to a home school , um , confere - or exhibition tomorrow .
It 's the first time I 've ever been to one .
Oh .
We 're going tomorrow night or Wednesday , we have n't decided yet .
Uh-huh .
And they 're gonna have all the -- they 've got , like , thirty five textbook vendors .
Oh , my gosh .
And so I said , " Well " I said , " Either that or there is a lady I know from eBay that 's wh-" actually I think got the Saxon Math off eBay , I take it back .
Because she 's a distributor for them .
Oh , I see .
And -- and she sells brand new but a -- a -- a third off retail .
Oh , gosh , well , that 's good .
Yeah , so I thought , well , I could just do that .
And I said I -- you know , phonics , I 've pretty well got a phonics program , um , online and working with her .
Oh , do you ?
I do n't know if I really want to invest in a phonics program .
Yeah , that Hooked on Phonics is kind of expensive I hear .
