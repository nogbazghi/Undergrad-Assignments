Georgia , where flue-cured crops have been struck by disease that
does n't hit as hard in North Carolina .
" If you 're a North Carolina grower in Nash County , you 're in
an ideal location to benefit from growing tobacco , " Boyd said .
But the migration of flue-cured tobacco to eastern counties will be
mitigated by tradition and modern-day risk management , said Blake Brown ,
the N.C .
State professor who is the state 's leading tobacco
economist .
Manufacturers and merchants will still want some flue-cured from the smaller
farms in the Old Belt of the Piedmont of North
Carolina and Virginia because tobacco grown in the region 's nutrient-rich
red clay hills has different qualities they still value and
because the eastern counties are more vulnerable to hurricanes and
other coastal storms , Brown said .
Old Belt tobacco is also
hand-harvested , which Piedmont farmers say heightens its quality .
But the bigger-is-better model also favors Piedmont growers who are experimenting
with a burley tobacco .
Hand-harvested and slowly air-cured , dark-leafed burley
is a smaller-volume but more-lucrative tobacco variety once geographically limited
to eight states under the old quota system , including Kentucky ,
Tennessee and western North Carolina .
CARVING A NEW NICHE
Farmers in the Old Belt can handle 15 to 20 acres
instead of the small plots typical of western North Carolina
or Kentucky .
The Piedmont also has cool enough temperatures for
burley , which is a valuable component of American blend cigarettes .
Because so many burley farmers in Kentucky , Tennessee and other states
have abandoned the crop , burley is also fetching a higher
price than flue-cured -- about $ 1.60 a pound .
That makes
burley an attractive option for an Old Belt farmer like
David Hartman of Walnut Cove , in Stokes County , who already
employs up to eight farm laborers to harvest his vegetable
and tobacco crops .
Like his father and grandfather , Hartman , 35 , is a flue-cured man
who hand-harvested 55 acres of bright leaf under a contract
with Phillip Morris .
But he also planted 15 acres of
burley , a crop that he was still stripping and baling
for market last week .
For Hartman , burley marks a small , muddy-booted step into free-market tobacco
farming .
He hopes this new tobacco combination gives him the
edge his smaller western Piedmont farm needs to compete in
a market that favors bigger farms in the eastern part
of the state .
" It 's a learning experience , " said Hartman , who also raises cattle and
grows corn , hay and beans on 1,200 acres about 106
miles northwest of Raleigh .
" Now , flue-cure -- I can do
that blind-folded .
But this is something new .
It 's been a
lot learning this year on burley . "
When Congress killed the tobacco program in October 2004 , it also
approved a $ 10.1 billion buyout for farmers and quota holders .
The buyout will pay North Carolina growers and quota holders
an estimated $ 3.8 billion over the next decade .
Younger growers like Hartman and Denning regard this money as a
cash reserve that lets them stay in the leaf-growing game .
Denning grew 180 acres of flue-cured under a Phillip Morris contract
