The resolution last week of a dispute over the flow of
natural gas from Russia to Ukraine has increased the Ukrainians '
reliance on fuel from Turkmenistan , a wild card that has
cast doubt on how a price agreement will ultimately play
out .
On Jan . 1 , Russia attempted to shut off gas supplies to
Ukraine after officials in Kiev , Ukraine 's capital , refused to pay
Russia 's price of $ 230 for each 1,000 cubic meters , a
more than fourfold increase over last year .
The showdown over Russian gas prices to Ukraine appeared to involve
deals with Saparmurat A. Niyazov , the president of Turkmenistan , an
isolated former Soviet republic in Central Asia with complex energy
politics .
Its low-price gas seems to have been central in
reaching an agreement .
Niyazov -- who likes to be called Turkmenbashi , or " the great
leader of all Turkmen " -- appears to have struck deals
with Russia and Ukraine that exceed his country 's production , even
as he sought more buyers in recent weeks .
Those deals have raised a wide array of doubts from industry
experts .
In the final days of last year , Turkmenistan committed
itself to sell 40 billion cubic meters of gas ( roughly
1.4 trillion cubic feet ) to Naftogaz of Ukraine , and 30
billion cubic meters more to Gazprom , the Russian monopoly .
But
Turkmenistan exported a total of only 45 billion cubic meters
of gas in 2005 , according to the Interfax news agency ;
it produced a total of 63 billion cubic meters , a
vast quantity but less than it had agreed to export
in 2006 .
Analysts say that the figures raise the question of whether Turkmenistan
can increase production enough to meet its commitments to both
Russia and Ukraine .
At the same time , Russia controls the
pipelines between Turkmenistan and Ukraine , and has said that they
are already operating at capacity .
In another puzzling aspect , the agreement that settled Ukraine 's supply crisis
set starkly different price levels for Russian gas and Turkmen
gas .
Under the terms of the deal , Russia will sell
gas to a Swiss-based company , RosUkrEnergo , at $ 230 for each
1,000 cubic meters .
That company in turn will sell gas
to Ukraine for $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters .
It would
presumably make up some of the difference with cheap Central
Asian gas from , among other places , Turkmenistan , which will charge
$ 50 per 1,000 cubic meters .
The gas promised from Turkmenistan would increase Ukraine 's imports by about
50 percent , raising the possibility that other Turkmen gas would
be sold for high prices outside the country , but no
details have been released .

The role of RosUkrEnergo has come under particular scrutiny .
The company
is half-owned by Gazprom , and half by Raiffeisen Investment , an
Austrian company and a unit of the RZB group .
Ukraine 's
national security service investigated RosUkrEnergo last summer after accusations of
links to organized crime , but no prosecution has ensued .
The lack of transparency in the deal and precisely how RosUkrEnergo
will make up the lower prices to Ukraine have raised
accusations of corruption from industry analysts and from Yulia V.
Tymoshenko , a former prime minister of Ukraine and a leading
figure in the political upheaval there a year ago in
which the Kremlin-backed candidate for president was forced to concede
the presidency to a Western leaning reformer , Viktor A. Yushchenko .
Tymoshenko was named prime minister , but was fired by the
new Ukrainian president late last year .

Ukraine approached Turkmenistan in December , apparently as a way to sidestep
Gazprom .
Niyazov agreed late in the month to sell gas to Ukraine
in a meeting with Volodymir Petruk , deputy chairman of the
board of Naftogaz , according to Turkmen television .
The Ukrainians confirmed
the purchase the next day , with President Viktor A. Yushchenko
saying that they would be buying Turkmen gas at a
rate of $ 50 for each 1,000 cubic meters , starting in
January .
Why Turkmenistan agreed to so low a price is
unclear .
Even if Turkmenistan manages to produce enough gas to meet its
commitments , it is unclear how it could transport the gas
through Uzbekistan , Kazakhstan and Russia to Ukraine .
Gazprom controls the
only pipeline between Turkmenistan and Ukraine , which operates nearly at
capacity .

The Russian minister of industry and energy , Viktor Khristenko , said last
week that the pipeline was full of Gazprom 's own output .
" The gas that is coming to Russian territory , " he said ,
according to Interfax , "is the gas that Gazprom actually has
on its balance and which it delivers to Europe . "
Turkmenistan has expressed interest in the lucrative Western market .
Late in
November , Niyazov served as host to a group of German
businessmen and offered to sell gas to Western Europe by
way of the Gazprom pipeline network , though he said that
the buyers would need Russia 's permission .
" Through this pipeline , " Niyazov said on Turkmen television , " we can sell
30 billion cubic meters to Russia , 30 billion cubic meters
to Ukraine and 30 billion cubic meters to Western Europe ,
and it is in fact possible .
"
Many industry analysts said they remained skeptical , noting that improvements would
be needed to increase capacity on the pipeline , something Gazprom
may have little interest in .
