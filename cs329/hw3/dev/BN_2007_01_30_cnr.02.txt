GALINA ESPINOZA , " PEOPLE" MAGAZIN
The tabloids had said that she was near 200 pounds .
She told " People " magazine that she 's 161 pounds and that since retiring from modeling in 2005 , her weight has gone up and down , like it does for a lot of women .
She 's fluctuated between about 148 and 162 .
Now hear what I have to say .
And this Thursday on her show , Tyra Banks sets the record straight .
And today I weigh 160 pounds .
So that is 10 pounds that I have gained , not 40 .
In that pre-recorded episode , she attempts to debunk her own weight rumors and also looks at eating disorders among models and body image .
It 's something Banks has done before for her program .
Even devoting a show in 2005 to disguising herself in a fat suit .
As I walked through the store , I felt the cold stares .
I talked with her then .
You said it was a heartbreaking experience .
Yes .
You 're going to make me tear up .
It just was heartbreaking because it was so in your face .
Though far from 300 pounds she wore in her TV disguise , Tyra herself now feels a similar pain of ridicule .
Despite her weight falling well within healthy guidelines for a woman of her height , 132 to 167 pounds according to the American Dietetic Association .
You guys , I eat on this show .
I eat all the time .
I talk about how much I love to eat .
And I gain weight and I lose weight constantly , just like everybody else .
And she says everybody else has to get used to seeing pictures of a formerly 126 pound super model happy with her healthy , normal weight .

But these are n't soldiers , they 're lawmakers returning from their visits with the power to shape the future there .
A top Democrat joins us in the NEWSROOM.
Speaking of power .
How about the power of the purse .
Congress has it , but are they willing to use it to stop the president 's new war plan .
Iraq 's debate ahead in the NEWSROOM.
And from retired to suddenly rich .
Absolutely astonished .
Could n't believe it and still do n't .
And we will meet the latest big Powerball winners in the NEWSROOM.
OK , let 's get you back to the newsroom now and T.J. Holmes .
T.J. is following this school bus accident .
A bus is not supposed to be on its side there .
No.
You never want to see a bus like that .
Anytime you hear about a bus accident , it will just kind of freak you out a little bit .
But certainly seeing one on its side like this , just a scary sight .
But what we 're hearing now , the word we 're getting from local authorities there , is that this bus involved in this accident -- again , it 's in Jefferson County just south of St . Louis -- that some 24 were on this school bus .
Some 24 students were on the bus .
None seriously injured .
We 're trying to get more information here now from Corporal Julie Scerine , who is with the highway patrol there , is on the line with us , I believe , we just got now and try to get more information .
