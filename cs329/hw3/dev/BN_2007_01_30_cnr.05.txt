Hello , everyone .
I 'm Kyra Phillips , live at the CNN world headquarters in Atlanta .
And I 'm Don Lemon .
Chewing the fat over the size of a former supermodel .
Tyra Banks says , get over it , her scale goes up and down like everybody else 's .
What do you think about America 's obsession with weight ?
We 're reading your e-mails straight ahead , right here in the CNN NEWSROOM.
2:30 Eastern time , T.J. Holmes working details on a developing story for us -- T.J. ?
Yes Kyra , we continue to follow and update this story for you out of West Virginia .
In Ghent , West Virginia , where there has been an explosion at a gas station there that has killed at least four people and the sheriff there tells us that they could -- that number could go higher , as many as seven possibly killed .
What happened they believe here this morning is that there was a leak , a gas leak in a propane tank here at the Flat Top Little General Store again in Ghent , West Virginia .
Authorities were called to the scene .
As soon as authorities got there , the explosion happened , essentially wiping out just about completely this entire gas station with the people that were there .
You are seeing this video .
There used to be a gas station there .
You ca n't make out anything , any semblance of a gas station there right now .
We talked to the sheriff , Danny Moore , a short time ago here live .
Here 's some of what he had to say about the situation they have there .
Actually , we do n't have the sound from him right now , but the sheriff Danny Moore said he 's going to have to go through .
What they are doing is the task of having to go through a lot of the debris and rubble and they do n't know -- they could find out , of course , find out how many people were working .
How many people were on shift at that time .
What they do n't know is exactly how many people may have just stopped in , how many customers may have been there .
So they certainly would n't be surprised and could possibly find more people under that rubble .
But we 're keeping an eye on this .
But at least we know of four dead after a gas station explosion at a gas station there in Ghent , West Virginia .
We 've been following this story for some time .
We 'll continue to follow it and bring you those developments , Kyra .
All right T.J. , thanks a lot .
And just back from Iraq , Democratic Congressman Tom Lantos is offering a grim view of the war and the Iraqi leadership .
The head of the House Foreign Affairs Committee was part of a delegation led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
He says Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is a long way from being the right man for the job .
In the CNN NEWSROOM this morning , Lantos also called President Bush 's troop escalation plan a mistaken policy .
I strongly favor deescalating for a tremendous range of reasons .
One of them being the global security position of the United States .
We have no strategic reserve .
Iraq is not the only danger point we face and to try to salvage an operation where so many fundamental mistakes have been made for so long a period is a wrong-headed policy .
