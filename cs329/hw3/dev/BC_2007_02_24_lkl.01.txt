Now , I can tell you that Howard , when he is around that baby , he treats her like gold , just like -- as a matter of fact , he treats her like platinum .
He treats Anna like gold , close to platinum .
They almost as one .
And that 's when you know that would make a good father .
If you -- if the father really loves the mom , which Howard really does love this mom , love Anna , you know he 's going to take care of the baby like it 's his own .
And other people that 's out there , this Van whatever , Zsa-Zsa 's husband ...
Yes .
Yes .
" BIG MOE" : ... and ...
The prince .
" BIG MOE" : The prince -- yes .
The prince and Larry , I mean these guys , they -- they did n't love Anna .
I mean , you know ...
Well , you do n't think Larry loved her ?
" BIG MOE" : No.
Not at all .
You do n't ?
" BIG MOE" : He -- I think he was infatuated .
Now , I met Larry the same time that Anna did at the Kentucky Derby back in 2004 .
And ...
I was there .
" BIG MOE" : Yes .
And he -- and he practically begged her to be a photographer , be her photographer .
And she agreed and he would travel around with us .
And if you -- you could see the pictures of Larry in the pictures and , you know , I mean he was like everyone else that wanted to be around Anna . Some ...
All right , let me get a break .
Hold it , Moe .
When we come back Moe will be joined by a couple who were also close friends to Anna .
Their daughter even sang at Daniel 's funeral .
And one of them was the first to see how Anna 's Bahamas mansion was ransacked right after her death .
We 'll talk about that and more , when we come back .
Big Moe remains with us .
He 's in Washington .
And now we 're joined in Ft .
Lauderdale by Patrik Simpson and Pol Atteu , friends and frequent business associates of Anna Nicole Smith , spent a great deal of time with her and Howard Stern at the Bahamas ' mansion .
In fact , their daughter -- they are a couple -- their daughter , Shelby , sang at Daniel 's funeral .
Patrik , how did you come to meet and know Anna Nicole ?
Well , Larry , I met Anna through Pol .
She was friends of Pol for several years , about eight years .
And when we first got together , Anna needed to approve of me and our relationship .
And so Pol took me up the house to meet her .
Larry , do you blame me ?
I had to bring , you know , the new guy around to Anna , my friend , to tell me everything was going to be OK .
How did your friendship begin , Pol , with Anna ?
Actually , she needed a dress for the Academy Awards .
And you know I do gowns and evening wear , right ?
So...
Right .
...
I was brought up to her house .
I made an appointment .
I went up there to see her .
I 've always loved and adored her , but then to see her in person was the most amazing -- and it was almost just unbelievable .
And we just got along great and kept a sincere , genuine , consistent friendship all along .
