Hillary Clinton showcases her experience -- and not just in government .
I am going to be asking people to vote for me based on my entire life and experience .
The fact that I 'm a woman , the fact that I 'm a mom is part of who I am .
A CBS News poll asked whether Hillary Rodham Clinton has the right experience to be president .
Fifty-nine percent said yes .
And Barack Obama ?
Twenty-seven percent said yes .
Forty-three percent did n't know .
Some Democrats worry that Clinton has too much political baggage , and that Obama does n't have enough .
That could open the way for Edwards , or another Democrat , especially one with experience in world affairs .
I believe these serious times demand serious people who have real-world experience in solving the challenges we face .
How important is experience to the voters ?
It varies from one election to the next .
In the turbulent year 1968 , voters were looking for a president with a lot of experience , Richard Nixon .
In 1976 , after Watergate , voters wanted someone untainted by Washington experience , Jimmy Carter .
Obama is betting that 2008 will be another year when experience is not a high priority -- Wolf .
All right , Bill , we will watch this part of the story together with you .
Coming up in our " Strategy Session " : Speaker Pelosi , the delegation of House Democrats have returned from Iraq more convinced than ever , they say , that President Bush 's policy in Iraq is doomed to fail .
And a chorus from Congress over the war in Iraq .
Will the Democratic-led Congress move to actually start cutting off funds ?
Senator Russ Feingold , standing by to join us live , he believes the Congress should do exactly that .
Stay with us .
You 're in THE SITUATION ROOM.
Many of us who cover presidential politics ca n't help but sit back and sometimes marvel that so much is actually going on in the 2008 race , and it 's only January 2007 .
Some are likening it to a campaign on steroids .
But our senior analyst , Jeff Greenfield , is looking at it from a somewhat different angle -- Jeff .
Wolf , since the rest of our colleagues are torn between wringing their hands about how soon the presidential campaign is starting and plunging full-scale into over- covering it , let 's take a bold step toward the next thing to worry about : how soon this will all end .
For a spectacular example of double- think , check out yesterday 's " New York Times . "
While the editorial page bemoans the 23-month campaign , two stories splashed across the front page , and lots more inside , help fuel the very focus the editorial page deplores .
Well , maybe it 's just that times it is , and they are , a'changing .
Welcome to Iowa .
The press corps is showing up in the early states like Iowa and New Hampshire in numbers that suggest it is 2008 already .
And now a gaggle of big states , tired of being overshadowed by the smaller states , are seriously thinking of moving their contests into February , which could well mean that the nomination contests will be effectively over around Groundhog Day .
