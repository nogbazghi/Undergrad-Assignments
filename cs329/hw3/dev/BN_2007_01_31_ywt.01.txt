Well , I think it would be powerfully significant and that we 've seen for some time now U.S. military official say that Iran continues to arm , train and fund Shia factions within Iraq .
We 've seen for some time Iran continually deny that .
But this investigation , these charges being made by the U.S. military , are essentially the first direct link between Iran and attacks that are being committed inside of Iraq .
We 'll have to wait and see what evidence is produced .
Keep in mind , as well , there are some Iranians still in coalition-force custody in Iraq .
But if it is proven , it exists potentially as a direct and overt of act of war by Iran against the United States .
It could ratchet up the tensions in a country that is already crippled by tensions between Shia and Sunni Iraqis .
Another dynamic , U.S. verse Iran on Iraqi soil is n't something that country needs , and is why the country 's prime minister today has said he does n't want a proxy war being fought inside of Iraq -- Hala .
All right .
Now if there 's alleged interference from Iran and accusations directed toward Iran , it is also the case for other regional actors and neighbors of Iraq , why is the U.S. more concerned with what Iran is allegedly doing .
Yes , we 've seen a number of Iraq 's neighbors come under criticism for not doing enough .
Syria is first among them for allowing foreign fighters to continue crossing that border into Iraq , but Iran essentially faces a longer list .
Iran has been growing in terms of prominence in the Middle East .
That has risen concerns like where I am , Sunni Egypt , Sunni Saudi Arabia , Sunni Jordan .
They are all increasingly banding together to try to get Iran 's influence curbed , not just in Iraq , but in a broader sense , in the Middle East .
Iran has influence in Lebanon , in the Palestinian areas .
And in Iraq , the allegations are of active involvement , not just in the political sphere of Iraq , but as well in terms of Shia factions that are fighting on the ground .
So Iran has faced more direct criticism , but keep in mind that broader context of the Sunni-Shia split that 's really emerging among the government 's here .
And when it comes to Iran it 's all about Iraq .
When it comes to Iraq , in these countries it 's all about Iran -- Hala .
All right , Aneesh Raman , live in Cairo .
Thanks , Aneesh -- Jim .
Let 's go into the heart of Europe now , where in Germany arrest warrants have been issued for 13 people suspected of being CIA workers .
They 're wanted in connection with the alleged kidnapping of a German citizen , who says he was taken into Afghanistan and tortured .
Details now from our own correspondent Frederik Pleitgen .
For over two years Khaled El-Masari has been fighting in court .
The 13 arrest warrants issued today come after German authorities got intelligence from Spanish police .
All 13 suspects are believed to be CIA operatives , but Munich state prosecutors say the names on the warrants are all aliases used by the alleged undercover agents .
