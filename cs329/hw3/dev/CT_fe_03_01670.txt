-- claim the same , um , for our purposes , religious identity --
Right .
-- and --
Just imagine that , for example , if a part of -- a part of the United States like New York , um , it belongs to some people in the ancient times and now they want to come back were America just to say , " Yeah , you can come back .
I will give --"
Mm .
-- you this land " .
I think it would be so hard to make this decision .
I mean --"
Mm .
-- um , so I think , uh-hum , the problem is if you fight with your enemy , you 're going to die too .
Your enemy is going to die and you 're going to die , too .
Mm .
You just should get ready to -- to dig out two graves --
Yeah .
-- for both you and your enemy .
I think the thing is to find some peace in that area , not by armed forces but try to think of some other ways to get it done , because if you use armed forces there is no way that there 's going to be peace there .

Mm .
-- as there are factions --
Yeah .

Yeah .
-- coverage goes .
Mhm .
I mean , because there -- there -- I mean there -- there are Israelis that are -- and a lot of , um , a lot of American Jews as well who are obviously --
Yeah .
-- very critical of , um , of Israel 's territorial expansion .
Mhm .
In fact , historically some of the most , um , outspoken opponents of Zionism were --
Mhm .
-- um , were Jews themselves .
Yeah .
Yeah .
Yeah .
But , um , ...
Right .
I know .
It --
And I -- I -- I 'm -- I 'm -- I 'm sorry , I know I 'm probably going off on a bunch of tangents here .
It 's a -- it 's a very large , um , topic with a lot of areas to , um , --
