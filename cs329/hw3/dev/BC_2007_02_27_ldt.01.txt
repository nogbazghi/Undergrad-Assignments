Our troops will be funded .
Does the public want Congress to restrict funding for the war ?
They 're split , like Congress .
The Democrats ' inability to act is taking a toll on them too .
In January , 60 percent of Americans said they trusted the Democrats in Congress more than President Bush on Iraq .
Most still do .
But the number is now down to 54 percent .
The number who trust President Bush has n't changed much .
What we 're seeing is more people who say they do n't trust either one -- Kitty .
Well , Bill , how is the president 's low approval ratings affecting him ?
Well , it 's certainly affecting his ability to get what he wants done .
His approval rating has been below a majority now for the entirety of his second term .
That 's more than two years .
That is the longest stretch on record for a president without majority support .
You have to go all the way back to Harry Truman in the early 1950s to find a president who lacked majority support for this long .
And some of your older viewers might remember that Truman also had a very unpopular war .
Thanks very much .

The numbers are staggering .
By age 17 , seven out of 10 teenagers have been offered illegal drugs .
Millions of teens each year use prescription drugs and alcohol .
And now hundreds of schools are fighting the drug war with random drug testing .
Christine Romans visited one of those schools .
These kids have all been drug tested at school .
They just -- it 's confidential .
I was comfortable doing it .
It 's a deterrent , so if someone has ever offered me something , I 'd be like , " No , I ca n't .
I 'm going to get tested . "
At Hunterdon Central High School in New Jersey , it 's a trip to the nurse 's office if your name comes up randomly .
Once they get to the health office , they get -- they pick a little ball out of the box .
