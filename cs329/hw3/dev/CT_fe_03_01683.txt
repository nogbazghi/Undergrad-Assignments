Yeah , I -- I -- I would -- I would agree very much .
I mean , you know , we put Saddam Hussein in power in the first place .
Twenty years later , we 're taking him out .
Right .
Right , I mean it 's similar -- unfortunately it 's similar to the fact that , you know , we had trained Osama bin Laden , um , and many others in that -- in that region , in many of the techniques that they were then able to use to kind of invade us , um --
Right .
It just has to do with who we -- what side we happen to be on at the moment , you know ?
Right .
Kind of fickle that way .
So I do n't know , I think , um , my problem is I just get so overwhelmed .
I just get -- I sort of come back at a certain point , I 'm like , " I ca n't watch news any more .
I ca n't think about it any more because I 'm here " you know ?
Right .
In a way , the best thing I can do maybe is just to try and live my daily life in a peaceful way , you know , as you were saying , like just trying not to be a aggressive person .
Oh , right .
Seems almost the most helpful thing that one can do , or not even not just aggressive , but sort of , uh , move - -- someone who moves towards peace .
Um --
Right .
But that 's hard to do , you know ?
It 's hard to actualize in a -- in the --
Oh , I --
-- smallest ways .
Yeah , it definitely is .
I mean , I -- I have friends who are over there right now , and I 'm really concerned that they 're -- you know , they may never come home --
Right .
-- and yet I -- you know , a - as much as I disagree with the war , that 's why I would n't protest it , because they 're there , you know ?
I do n't want --
Right .
-- me to happen to get filmed and see one of my -- and my -- one of my buddies just catch it and think that I 'm , you know , trying to get him -- you know , not supporting him --
Right .
-- but in the s - -- you know ?
And in the same respects , they did n't want to be there , I mean , they 're --
Right .
-- National Guard , they 're not army m - -- you -- you know , they 're not career military people so , you know , out --
And even --
-- here in Oregon --
Sorry , go ahead , " Out here in Oregon --" .
Out -- out here in Oregon , the National Guard went before the -- the career military people did .
Huh .
Wow .
So , we s - -- 'cause we -- you know , we do n't have the security alerts that you guys are having back there .
