I was in the clothing biz for 10 years and used clothing steamers often .
This is just as good as any of the $ 400 professional units I used .
For those who claim it does not replace an iron ...it 's damn close .
For those who claim it does not get out wrinkles from all or certain fabrics , you do not know how to use it .
This steamer produces plenty of steam to get out any wrinkles from any fabric .
As far as the steam board they have here for $ 60 .
I made one for $ 20 , with 2ft x 4ft 1/4 inch mdf board , some door hooks , cotton batting and a large towel for the covering .
It works great ! !
