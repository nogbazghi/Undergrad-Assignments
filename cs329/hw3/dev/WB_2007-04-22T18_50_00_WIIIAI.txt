Azmi Bishara , one of the 3 ( or 4 ? ) Palestinian members of the Israeli Knesset and the chairman of the Balad party , has fled the country and resigned from the Knesset because of some sort of secret investigation of him .
There is a gag order on exactly what is being investigated , although , in a triumph for Israeli openness , the gag order on reporting the existence of the gag order was lifted this week .
After meeting the Egyptian president , Maliki said , â I clarified to the president the reality of what is going in Iraq , which is not a civil or sectarian war .â 
Sadly , he did nât clarify for the rest of us the reality of what is going on in Iraq .
What is the Arabic for âcrapfestâ ?
