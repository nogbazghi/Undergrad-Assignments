A deadly connection ?
New suggestions this morning Iran is behind that sneak attack that killed five American soldiers in Iraq .
And up and about .
New pictures of the Cuban leader , Fidel Castro , for the first time in months .
We 're showing them ( ph ) on this AMERICAN MORNING.
Good morning .
Welcome back , everybody .
It 's Wednesday , January 31 .
I 'm Soledad O'Brien .
And I 'm Miles O'Brien .
We 're glad you are with us .
Happening this morning in Iraq , the Bush administration is linking Iran to that brazen Trojan horse attack that killed five U.S. soldiers in Karbala .
The Pentagon claims the raid was too sophisticated for home-grown Iraqi militants .
The attackers entered a U.S. compound on January 20 .
They wore U.S. uniforms .
They drove black Suburbans with tinted glass , favored by U.S. convoys .
In Ghent , West Virginia -- that 's south of Charleston -- firefighters this morning searching for more possible victims after an explosion at a gas station .
At least four were killed , including two emergency workers , at least five others hurt .
Investigators suspect a propane leak .
New pictures this morning of Fidel Castro .
Cuban TV claiming they were shot Monday as Castro met with Venezuela president Hugo Chavez .
Castro , now 80 , is recovering from intestinal surgery .
He looks a little better than did he in the last tape we saw in October .
Senator and presidential hopeful , Barack Obama , is offering a new plan to bring U.S. troops home from Iraq .
He 's introducing a bill to pull all U.S. troops out of Iraq by the spring of '08 .
And putting the brakes on President Bush 's plan to send more troops in now -- Soledad .
Earlier this morning I spoke to another Democratic presidential hopeful , Senator Joe Biden , officially announcing his presidential campaign today , and I asked him about the president 's plan to send more troops into Iraq .
Here 's what he said .
When I came on your program between Christmas and New Year 's and said I 'm going to oppose this escalation , there was n't anybody out there saying that .
And all of a sudden now you 're hearing from John McCain , sending out benchmarks with , quote , "teeth in it . "
You have John Warner with a resolution almost exactly the same as the one I put out .
And I do n't care which one passes .
And so what you have is you have n't heard -- you have n't heard a single voice in the United States Congress stand up and say , " I 'm absolutely sure what the president is doing is right .
This is the way to go . "
Now , so if the president does not respond to the voices , as well as the votes in the United States Congress , representing the American people , then we 're in real trouble .
He will respond as long as he understands there is virtually no support for this escalation of his war .
Let me ask you a quick question about some of the quotes you had in " The New York Observer " .
Very interesting , by the way .
I encourage everybody to take a look at that .
One of the things you said about Hillary Clinton is her plan for Iraq is "nothing but disaster . "
That 's your quote there .
