All eyes on Wall Street this morning as stocks are poised for maybe a rebound after yesterday 's plunge .
That 's what the futures are telling us ; 25 minutes after the hour .
Ali Velshi has been looking at his crystal ball all morning .
What 's it telling you ?
Well , it 's telling us that , in fact , we might be ready to open the stock market , at the Dow maybe 70 , 80 points higher right off the start .
We are looking at what 's happened around the world .
Ever since yesterday 's drop , we closed 461 points lower on the Dow , and we saw Asian markets catch on to that .
We did see Shanghai , where this whole problem started , actually close about 4 percent higher ; and European markets , which are still trading , were lower , and they 're now they 're not as low .
They 're all in negative territory , but not as bad as they were earlier .
So , it does seem like the situation is improving .
Certainly if U.S. markets suffer today , they ca n't blame China for it .
What we are looking at is a recovery from tomorrow .
We 're looking at testimony by Fed chief Ben Bernanke , we 're looking at numbers on existing housing sales coming out this morning , but at 8:30 we 're also looking at a report on GDP.
That 's what our economy is doing .
There 's an estimate for that , and if it comes out lower than that estimate , that is going to weigh on markets .
Right now all that selling that was done yesterday , there are opportunities for professional traders , at least , to get in and buy .
When you take it all together , it is not as big a drop as you would think since the market is going up for so long .
And it has n't had a pullback ; those typical corrections as they call it .
So , a lot of folks are saying unusual that it happened all in one fell swoop yesterday , but it does n't sound -- it 's not as serious as it sounds .
We talk about 400 and 500 points in a market that is over 12,000 points .
Remember , that percentage drop , Miles , is the thing that we look at , and it 's not as serious as it sounded .
Right now , people wandering into the New York Stock Exchange feeling a little more positive than they were at 4 o'clock yesterday .
Are you a buyer today , Ali ?
If I were buying , if I had time to be doing it , I would be buying today .
But that , you know , all depends on what your feeling is about risk .
Ali Velshi , thank you very much .
Much more on the markets coming up .
We 're watching markets around the world for you .
New York , China , Europe .
We 'll see how they shake out for you .
What that will mean for the Dow this morning .

Plus , our in-depth look at HPV.
Just the facts today .
We 'll go to the epicenter of that uproar over the HPV vaccine .
Who is behind it all ?
