One could argue either way for the stainless construction of this vacuum .
The upside is that it is easy to clean and will last longer than plastic .
The downside is that it dents and pits and is susceptible to being severely bent to the point where the top would no longer fit ( this has not happened to me ) .
The motor is strong , the filter adequate , and the carrying dolly is a great feature .
Like many high-end tools , it is expensive but worth the extra money if you plan to keep it for a long time .
