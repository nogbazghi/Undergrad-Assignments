Today is Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day .
Bush put out a statement .
It touches some of the bases that need to be touched : 1.5 million Armenians dead ( well , he said âas many asâ  1.5m ) , need to remember and examine the historical events , blah blah blah .
And some that did nât need to be touched : âOur Nation is grateful for Armeniaâs contributions to the war on terrorâ .
And missed one altogether : it referred to âmass killings ,â  but failed to characterize them as genocide or in any way acknowledge the ethnic-religious impulse towards extermination .
Indeed , âmass killings â  is not coupled with any mention of the mass killers : those âas many as 1.5 million Armeniansâ  merely âlost their lives .â 
As I said about last yearâs presidential message , Bush âcalls it a âtragedy , â  which is a word that does not entail responsibility , especially not Turkish responsibility .â 
Imagine a similar statement about the Holocaust that shied away from naming the Nazis .
Speaking of ethnic-religious impulses towards extermination , Bushâs other statement this morning ( which he made with a helicopter behind him )
was yet another demand for a âcleanâ  bill funding his dirty wars .
âIt makes no sense to tell the enemy when you start to plan withdrawing , â  he said .
Speaking of making no sense , I think he was supposed to say âwhen you plan to start withdrawing .â 
That enemy , of course , is Al Qaida ; Bush these days is back to ignoring the existence of a civil war in Iraq .
He complains that the bills are âlegislative mandates telling [ US generals [ which enemies they can engage and which they cannot .â 
I have no idea what heâs talking about .
He used the phrase âprecipitous withdrawalâ  twice .
Heâs against it .
He did not explain how withdrawal of troops from Iraq in 2008 , as opposed to 2003 , could in any way be described as precipitous .
