For the guy with the broken front caster ( " How do I GET new casters for this shop vac... ? ) - I had the same problem ( except I had mine for several years before it broke ) and I called Shop Vac Customer Service at 570-326-0502 and they are sending me a new caster part kit gratis .
The rep was very gracious , especially since she noted that my model ( 8045 ) was " a really old one " .
I gave 3 stars because I was required to give a rating but I have an older product that is much more similar to the 925 but only 4.5 peak HP.
It is incredibly loud - like a jet engine in your garage - hopefully the newer models are quieter .
