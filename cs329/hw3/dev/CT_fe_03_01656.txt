Yeah .
[inaudible] .
But before that when there were problem with the , um , you know , the suicide bombers in -- in , ah , Israel ?
Were you in- into it at all ?
I mean , did you follow the news on that too ?
No.
Not really ?
Uh-uh .
Yeah .
That 's an unfortunate thing .
I -- I was following the news on that and it 's just heartbreaking , every time you hear the news about , you know , how innocent people got killed for -- ah , well , to the Arabs maybe it 's something that they really believe .
Unfortunately a lot of the suicide bombers there sort of , um , I would say got fooled by the -- their leaders , you know .
Mhm .
They were promised a lot of money and , um , what they 're going to get in heaven .
That 's kind of --
Huh .
That 's kind of weird but that 's what they believe that --
Mhm .
-- if they die doing -- carrying the mission , you know , as a suic - suicide bomber , they said they -- they can get , um , a lot of , ah , things when they get to heaven .
And a lot of it too , they do it in motiv- motivation of , um -- for their -- their living relatives or family .
Yeah .
They 're -- they are promised a lot of , um , money and a lot of fame , I guess .
They 're --
They may be scared of their leader .
Mhm , yeah .
Or --
But , you know , they -- they get some kind of f - fame if they 're , um , they die as a suicide bomber .
Yeah .
Weird as it is but that 's -- that 's what 's going on over there .

No.
Ah , a - --

So , um , do you read news from the internet or just --
Mostly from the internet .
-- from TV ? Yeah , that 's good .
Well --
What do -- what do you do ?
I , um , I work .
I , ah , I work only part time so I have quite a bit of time to go on it and kind of follow the news , you know .
I- the problem in the Middle East it -- was n't really my -- my interest but because of , um , a lot of turmoil there , I guess , that 's what got Bush on the -- on TV and on n- newspaper a lot .
So , most of the time it 's the main headline everywhere .
Yeah , I m - --
So we 're just gonna --
I mostly --
Mhm .
I mostly follow things that 's going on around in the United States .
Mhm , yeah .
So , unfortunately you 're kind of sucked into it whether you want it or not because it -- that 's just a main headline , you know , on the news --
