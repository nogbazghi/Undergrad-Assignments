Right , yeah .
That 's true .
Just -- I tell you , I -- I do n't think I would want to be an enemy of the United States right now .
No, I certainly would n't , but then , on the other hand , I would n't want my son there either .
Oh , is n't that sad .
We 've really had a remarkably low number of casualties considering .
We 've had quite a few in -- in my area .
Have you ?
Where 's your area ?
In Ohio .
Ahah .
Yeah .
There 's been quite a few young men --
Oh .
-- who have n't come back .
So sad .
Yes , it 's very sad .
I mean , there were , er , quite a few groups from here that went --
Ah .
-- you know , reserve units .
See , out here in Arizona I mostly know retired people , so unless somebody has a grandson or something .
Yeah , but you 've got those air for -- you 've got an air force base out there .
Yes , but that 's , uh , --
Army .
-- that 's far enough west of where we are .
That 's probably an hour and a half from us --
Oh .
-- so we do n't really have contact with people connected there either .
Ahah .
I mean , you know it 's there , but it does n't -- we do n't hear the stories of the connections and the people and things , you know .
Yeah .
It 's just scary for the people that live around that area .
Yeah .
I think , which might daughter and my sister live right there .
Do they ?
Yeah .
Out by Luke ?
Not far from there .
Oh , my .
Yeah , so ...
Huh .
But anything within miles from there , you know , if something were to happen .
Well , we 've got that huge -- in fact it 's the biggest nuclear --
Right .
-- power plant around --
Yes .
-- out here and I figure that would certainly make a good target .
Yeah .
I frankly have been extremely surprised by the lack of retaliatory terrorism .
Well , yeah , me too , but I 'm thrilled by it .
Yeah .
It does n't make me comfortable , though .
Yeah .
I -- I think they wait for to us let our guard down .
I -- I just ca n't believe we 've split them up that badly , although I think we have done some damage --
Yeah .
-- to the chain of command .
Well , that 's the important thing , is to get to the top there .
Yeah .
The top people , the one giving , you know , the ones giving the orders --
Ahah .
-- and you know , hopefully we 've hurt them enough --
Aha .
-- that either if he 's alive he does n't have his men under him or he 's not alive .
I 'd -- I 'd like to see -- see somebody capture bin Laden .
