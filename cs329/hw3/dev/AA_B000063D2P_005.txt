We live in the Northeast where it gets quite dry in the winter due to heating - it makes sleeping far more comfortable .
We are big fans of the Vornado humidifiers - we have one in each bedroom .
Depending on your water quality , these wicks will need to be changed anywhere between every 2-4 months .
If not , the humidifier is far less efficient and will not properly humidify the rooms .
