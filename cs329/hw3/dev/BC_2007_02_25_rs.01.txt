It was Iraq that brought al Qaeda back to life .
The military is much too small for the task at hand .
Time now for the latest from the news business in our " Media Minute . "
Jennifer Mee ( ph ) , a Florida teenager , might seem an unlikely get for the morning shows .
Then she started hiccuping and could n't stop for four weeks .
The " Today " show booked her , but " Good Morning America " would not give up .
In fact , reports the " St .
Petersburg Times , " " GMA" bookers called Jennifer 57 times and slipped notes under her hotel door in an effort to steal her away .
But " Today " wound up with the scoop .
First it 's kind of funny .
It 's not funny , is it , anymore ?
Not no more .
It 's not .
Not at all .
How are you coping ?
The morning shows focusing on the problems of ordinary people with hiccups .
" The Washington Post , " led by Pulitzer Prize winner Dana Priest , spent four months investigating the squalid , cockroach-infested conditions and shoddy care at the Army 's Walter Reed Medical Center , but wait until you hear what happened when Priest told military officials about the story six days before the paper planned to publish .
