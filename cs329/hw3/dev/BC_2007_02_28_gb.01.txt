OK . Now , you -- correct me if I` m wrong .
You believe that the reason why this is used now is because of a lack of education .
Is that right ?
Definitely .
Explain that .
Well , the American educational school systems , they do n` t educate the kids on history , true history .
I mean , kids have absolutely no idea that America enslaved Africans for 246 years , then 100 plus years of Joe Crowism .
I mean , the kids have no clue that their ancestors were enslaved and this word was used to dehumanize them .
See , I got to tell you , I find that really hard to believe .
Because it -- slavery is -- is used as an excuse a lot of times .
It is unfortunate that maybe the actual context of slavery is n` t taught .
But if that is true , how can we teach -- because I think the " N" word is a hateful word .
So how can we teach the real meaning of the " N" word to people who apparently do n` t know it , if you`re accurate , who do n` t know what it means , without teaching the hatred of the races ?
Well , I do n` t think that` s possible .
I think you have to teach the " N" word where -- when it was used to enslave human beings , and slavery would have to be discussed .
Because , again , we had 246 years .
No, no .
No, no , I agree with that .
What I` m asking you is how do you teach such a hatred -- hateful word if your premise is , you know , young adults in America do n` t understand slavery , do n` t even know what the word really means .
How do you teach that word and what it really meant to African- Americans without passing on hatred of the white man ?
It` s just true .
It` s true history .
You have to teach it .
It` s not passing hatred on the white man ; it` s just passing on history .
And this is what one group of people who happened to be white did to another group of people who were African , black people .
Thanks , Marcia .
Coming up , " The Real Story " on how illegal immigration is ruing families in Mexico , next .
All right .
Welcome to " The Real Story . "
Even though they failed to pass their bloodless nonbinding resolution against the war , it is no secret that the Democrats on Capitol Hill are dead set against the president` s proposed troop surge in Iraq .
Unfortunately for them , the real story tonight is news , news today that the surge-based Iraqi security crackdown is working .
A new Bush administration plan is saving lives each and every day .
Now , even though this is an opinion show and I` m conservative , this is n` t opinion .
These are n` t some skewed statistics from some crazy conservative on your television .
This is according to the Associated Press .
Since the security crackdown launched on February 14th , there has been a dramatic drop in slayings by sectarian death squads , by as much as 50 percent .
Again , A.P. numbers , not mine .
I do n` t care what side of the aisle you`re on .
Any plan that is saving the lives of Iraqi citizens and helping Iraqi security officers get better at protecting their own people is a reason to celebrate .
