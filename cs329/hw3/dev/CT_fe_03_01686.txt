That 's true .
I mean , they got us September eleventh .
Mhm .
Think of what they 're going to try and get with us next because America is , like , -- is really taking advantage of its power .
The UN told America not to go and America said , " We 're going to go in without you " , you know ?
Mhm .
Actually , I saw that in -- in a way as the fall of the United Nations , the beginning of -- of the fall of the United Nations .
If they 're going to be totally ignored , then what -- what purp- -- what , you know , what purpose are they -- will they be able to serve in the future .
Mhm .
So , um , it 's -- it 's just really sad and it 's unfortunate that , uh , this has happened and , like , you , uh , anything co- -- is possible , particularly after -- when we observe the events -- events of September eleventh , I know .
What did you say about September eleventh ?
When we -- when we reflect upon what happened September the eleventh , it is scary in light of the -- the , uh , current , uh , situation in the east .
Uh , it is scary and I cannot imagine our children being that terrified , you know ?
Mhm .
Or all the suffering that 's involved , all the things that -- that we gloss over every day or take for granted every day .
We have , uh , you know , uh , running water and -- and -- and , uh , other conditions here .
We have food and we 're not , uh , -- our pla - -- our homes have -- have not been , um , destroyed or bombed or anything , so we have a lot to be thankful for in addition to the concerns , uh , the other , uh , things that are happening .
Well , do -- do -- have you ever been involved in one of these conversations before ?
No. No, and I think this is the answer to say , no , I have n't .
Mhm .
Okay .
How -- how about you ?
No, I 'm kind of figuring out what exactly , like , they 're looking for in the conversations .
Well , I 've found this conver- -- our conversation quite interesting and inform - informative .
Yeah .
I could -- we do a - -- we -- we do agree on a number of things .
Yeah .
I 'm wondering if they were expecting us to disagree , you know , and --
-- to show , like , how a couple of [inaudible] , like , you know , go at it --
Mhm .
-- but I think it -- extraordinarily enough , like , I feel , like , though , like , you 're going to have , like , strong opinions on it --
Mhm .
-- I feel , like , the world really does n't -- I do n't know , sometimes I feel , like , people really do not agree with the war but then I realize that , like , it 's , like , people use the same exact reason to agree with the war that people use to disagree , like , they try and say we should have war --
