This is the definition of a solid thriller .
Too often , I 'm annoyed by dialogue or plot devices that feel shoe-horned in just so the author can stunt a little .
Twisted Justice feels real : you can see yourself making the same decisions , good and bad , that the characters make .
That authenticity elevates the novel far above most of the other books I 've read in the genre .
The novel also does n't rely just on the murder mystery aspect of the plot : it fleshes out the relationships between characters who are , once again in recognizable fashion , often acting on gut instinct , sometimes to disastrous effect .
A fascinating and assured addition to the mystery thriller canon .
