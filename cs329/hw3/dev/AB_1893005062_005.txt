This book offers an interesting and completely comprehensible overview of diabetes .
It is not a "how-to " book , nor does it pretend to be .
Rather , it gives you the background information you need to better understand your care plan that your physician , dietician , and whomever else prepares with you .
While there are many other volumes on the subject , I recommend this one as an essential resource for any living with diabetes or a diabetic .
