But Chavez says this video was shot yesterday , yesterday afternoon during Chavez 's visit .
Castro also talks at one point in a weak voice about the fall that he took in 2004 , saying to Chavez that the things seemed to have come one after the other .
But , as I said before , this is the first new video we 've seen since October -- Wolf .
Morgan , thanks very much .
Morgan , our man in Havana , is going to stay on top of the story for us .
Other important news that we 're following .
Let 's get some more on the raging battle over Iraq and a serious question that many critics are asking : should Congress simply take the ultimate step and cut off funding for the war ?
Democratic Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin thinks so .
Just a short while ago , I asked Senator Feingold what he thinks of criticisms that doing so would hurt U.S. troops in Iraq .
Well , that 's just another one of these red herring , false argument that 's put out .
Nobody 's talking about taking anything away from the troops .
What we 're saying is there should be a timeframe to redeploy the troops .
In other words , we do n't say to somebody , " Hey , give us your rifle and give us your helmet .
You 're going to say here in Baghdad . "
The fact is , our bill that I 'm putting in tomorrow would say the troops have to be out within six months after the bill is passed .
That 's the safest thing for the troops , is to not be in Iraq .
In an interview with " Politico.com" ,
this new website , you told Roger Simon that you were upset about what you called the timidity of several of your fellow Democrats who refused to join you in using the constitutional power of the purse to stop the war .
Well , my concern has been in the past that sometimes Democrats have been too timid on this issue .
There 's a little bit of old habits dying slowly going on here in the Senate .
But I 'm optimistic .
The non-binding resolutions that are coming up , Wolf , are ones that I can support as long as they are only the first small steps .
What has to follow and what I hope Democrats and Republicans will follow with is a binding resolution that says , " This thing has to end , we have to get out of Iraq . "
And I feel on the Senate floor just a few minutes that many Democrats as well as Republicans are realizing that we have to have a real strategy , not just resolutions .
In other words , you think that Harry Reid , your Democratic leader , the majority leader in the Senate , Nancy Pelosi on the House side , Hillary Clinton , among others , they 're not doing what they should be doing right now , namely using the power of the purse ?
Well , I think the proof will be in the pudding .
What 's being done now , the idea of having a resolution that says , " Look , this policy does n't make sense and we should n't have the escalation . "
That 's good .
And what they 're doing is positive .
It 's just that it 's a very small step .
It 's almost like a sideshow compared to what has to be the real step , what the American people asked for in November , which is we need to redeploy the troops from Iraq , not just stop the surge .
The troops have to come out .
This is hurting our national security .
It 's hurting our military .
And I think the leaders of the Democratic Party in both the House and the Senate will come around on this .
