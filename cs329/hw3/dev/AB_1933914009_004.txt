The first half of the book tells the author 's story in an entertaining way but I jumped past all that and went to the meat of the book .
What she has to tell is just pretty much common sense if you have bought and sold your own home and know how real estate investment works .
She gives some good advice if you are ready to put in a lot of hours and hard work and do n't expect to make a living from it too soon , maybe never .
She uses a lot of pump-you-up hype in her story style so try to look at the facts and stay grounded in reality .
