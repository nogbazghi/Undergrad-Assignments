Yeah , all that .
Yeah , yeah .
We 'll be focused on that .
[inaudible ] --
And then eventually --

Yeah , yeah .
Like , he 's not in control of anything any more .
Right .
But I do n't think he 's dead .
Physically , yeah .
Hm .
Wonder where he 's hiding ?
Yep , probably in a hospital or a nursery .
I -- I -- I 'm betting one of those two places .
Maybe even a school .
Have you h - -- have you heard the latest Saddam joke ?
No.
You know Saddam has all these doubles ?
Yeah .
Well , they gather 'em all up and they say --
