I bought this vacuum through an auction and saved a lot of money .
I have a dog that sheds a lot and previously tried to use a Roomba vacuum to clean the carpet but it did n't make a dent on the hair .
I have had the vacuum 4 days and used it twice , and so far , pulled up enough hair and dirt to make two more dogs .
I cannot tell you how much I like this vacuum !
Best investment I have made in ages ! !
