I stumbled across Steve Chandler 's writings as I was meandering one day through the local bookstore .
I was frustrated and disillusioned by my small business and wondering if I should continue it .
I accidentally ( if you believe in accidents ) found his book , " 9 Lies That are Holding Your Business Back ..." , co-authored by Sam Beckford .
The first chapter deeply offended me ; so I knew that I needed to buy it .
These guys knew way more than I did about business and I wanted to learn every bit .
This discovery led me to other Steve Chandler treasures and I promptly purchased this book , The Small Business Millionaire .
First of all , we meet our hero , Jonathan .
I was shocked to discover his obsession with the hit show Magnum P.I. , because I currently am watching the entire series via DVD with my husband .
Jonathan 's character obviously has a 'wealth mentality ' and he assists his friends , Jennifer and her father Frank in their restaurant business .
Anyone who has ever owned a business will see their thoughts mirrored in Frank 's comments throughout the book .
Anyone who has n't lost hope in their business will eat up every word uttered by Jonathan .
Jonathan obviously has a good heart with an excellent business mind ; the challenge for us is not only to listen , but to be brave enough to follow his advice .
My small business has improved dramatically in the short timespan that I have read this book .
I 'd like to see where I am in a year from now , as I apply these techniques to my everyday life .
This book is worth every penny , along with " 9 Lies " and " Reinventing Yourself" .
Thanks Steve : )
