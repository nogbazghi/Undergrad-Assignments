I know .
That was the best , was n't it ?
Mhm , yes .
Um , yeah , I -- I was just , like -- well -- well , the one girl -- I mean , I thought that was the miracle itself --
Yeah .
-- 'cause she was all by herself and then they said that there was oth - -- but those other -- like , five of those other people that were rescued too , they were with her , right ?
Yes .
Yeah .
So , I mean , I thought , " Oh my God , you know , they only found her , what about the rest of 'em ? "
But then , you know , that 's -- yeah , that was really good .
That 's one nice thing that came out of this .
Did you -- did you happen to hear how these people are mentally , if they 're okay or ... ? I mean , I have n't heard too much on that .
Yeah , I really have n't either .
Um , I heard that the o - -- the one woman , the black woman , Sh- -- I think her name is Shoshana --
Yeah .
-- Johnson .
I heard that , um , when they found out like -- I guess after , like , they captured 'em and they found out she was a woman , she said that they treated her really well .
They , you know , they did n't seem to bother her too much .
But , um --
Well , they do kind of hold women in high regard over there , do n't they ?
I -- ah , I -- I think so .
I think -- well , I do n't know .
Although they 're not allowed to do a lot .
Do anything , yeah , exactly .
I was just going to say , you know , they 're not allowed to do anything and they have to hide their faces all the time but -- So , I do n't know .
But , um -- but I do n't , as far as the other guys I do n't know , but I thought it was kind of weird how when they were on -- you know , they showed that video ?
Mhm .
You know , of them being c - -- they looked like they were terrified , you know ?
Oh , yeah .
And -- and I 'm sure that they would be .
But it -- I -- I do n't know .
It seems like they 're all happy an- -- maybe they 're just happy to be out right now and do n't want to have to deal with everything that happened to 'em then .
I do n't know .
And all those bodies they found .
Where were they from ?
[several inaudible words ]
Yep , yeah .
Ooh .
I do n't -- yeah , it - it 's sad .
I ca n't imagine like , you know , all the parents and young wives and stuff , like , to have people out there .
It 's got to be a scary thing , not knowing .
I know .
My husband and I were talking and we wonder if stuff like this keeps on if they 'll bring the draft back and young men , you know --
