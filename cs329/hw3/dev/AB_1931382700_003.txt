I found this book to be good with many ideas .
It did get a little redundant at times , which can probably be attibuted to emphasizing approaches to mental training .
It definitely gets across the need for mental preparedness and ways to go about it .
Reading it a couple times and and doing the exercises included in the various chapters is necessary to get the most from the book and approach .
