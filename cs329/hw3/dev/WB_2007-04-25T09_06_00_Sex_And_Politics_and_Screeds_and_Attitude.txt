rosie 's out .
as i 've noted before , t 's got to have the tv on in her salon and switched to abc when the view is on .
that 's never been the case before rosie .
rosie brought in viewers .
( and the ratings demonstrated that . )
without rosie , it 's back to a yawn fest .
i know some people love to celebrate them some joy behar .
i do n't .
she trashed a friend of mine and i do n't tolerate that shit .
she did so on air .
star jones did and so did the hideous meredith .
barbara had to apologize for the 3 losers .
but i do n't forget that .
and the trashing was such that joy can claim left 'til the cows come home but she proved she was nothing but a shitty little person willing to play republican when it was 'fun' and when the whole country was drinking the kool-aid .
so the gab-fest will most likely be cancelled after rosie leaves and it deserves to be .
rosie made the show .
i 'm not dropping gonzales , by the way .
i just planned to write about the moyers ' special .
i know some readers will check it out due to the fact that i 've said the mcclatchy boys are hotties ( they are , i 'm not hyping ) .
it 's worth watching .
but i 'm not going to pretend like it was amazing television .
all media critics were white males .
the issue of who gets invited to the table remains a problem even for bill moyers .
and , sadly , that point is only driven home more by the fact that his 1st friday episode ( friday after next ) will feature 2 white males as a guest .
i really do n't think that was the pbs mandate - create a space for more white males .
that 's it for me tonight .
here 's c.i . 's ' Iraq snapshot : '
Wednesday , April 25 , 2007 .
Chaos and violence continue , the United Nations raises the issue of Iraqi fatalities , US House Rep and 2008 presidential contender Dennis Kucinich moves to impeach Dick Cheney , the wall in Baghdad continues to be an issue , and more .
Starting with war resisters .
Last Saturday , the latest public war resisters spoke in Greensboro , Terri Johnson .
jarnocan ( North Carolina World Can't Wait ) reports , " Terri Johnson of Greensboro was like a lot of other young people with limited options after high school who are set upon by US Army recruiters .
She believed the promises of the recruiters who told her that the Army was nothing more than a good shot at a college education and a prosperous future .
She discovered , as do many others who sign up , that not only wa she signing her life away , but the lives of people targeted by the illegal and immoral war on Iraq as well .
So she did the right thing .
She refused to fight . "
Jordan Green ( Yes !
Weekly ) notes that " the granddaughter of past Gressnsboro NAACP President Gladys Shipman , deliberately failed to complete her final fitness test at Fort Jackson in South Carolina , and then went AWOL on Sept. 28 , 2006 , the day before graduation . "
Speaking at a rally at Governmental Plaza , Johnson stated : " I 'm not anti-war one hundred percent because some wars are worth fighting for .
But this war is not worth fighting for .
I really do n't look at myself as a hero .
I was just doing it for me because [the war ] was n't for me .
There were a lot of my buddies who did n't want to drop out like me , but they did n't have have the courage to make the decision I did . "
On leaving during basics , Johnson stated , " All you got to do is leave .
Throw the towel in .
They cannot stop you .
Stay gone for thirty-one days .
Get your two-way ticket to Lousiville , Kentucky .
The MPs will meet you there and pat you down .
You will be there for four days and eat this horrible food .
The only thing you cannot do is get a federal job .
Okay , I was n't that interested in working for the federal government anyway .
The other thing you ca n't do is re-enlist in another branch of the military . "
