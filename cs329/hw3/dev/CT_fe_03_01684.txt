Tony Blair seems like a cool guy .
Yeah .
But -- 'cause I 'm really surprised that Britain did come behind us .
I figured they would n't , and I figured maybe France would .
But , I 'm glad it 's Great Britain instead of France .
Mm .
Tell Daddy I 'm on the phone doing a survey .
Um
Uh , my husband , he hates me being on the computer .
Oh , mine too , I 'm always on there .
He hates me being on the phone , but whenever he sees me getting those little checks in , he do n't say too much .
Well , that 's right .
Yeah , all the , you know , points programs and things like that ?
Mhm .
Exactly , 'cause , uh , m - I know I 'm getting off the subject , but my husband is , like , " You're always on the computer" , but look what I can get , I mean I 've got tons of stuff from --
Yeah , me too .
-- being on here , from contests and stuff , and he 's finally realising that she 's not just wasting all her time on the computer .
Right .
Yeah , mine likes when we get to the Home Depot and it 's like , " Look , I got a free gift certificate for Andy though " .
I mean , I 've looked at -- I 've got mouse and keyboard combo .
I 've got all kind of different -- full size of make up , uh , things from contests and all , and he 's , like , " Where are you getting that stuff from ? " " The computer " .
Mhm .
And I have about thirty dollars worth of survey checks in my purse now , but
Well , that 's great .
I 'm just saving them .
Yeah .
I know I 'll need the money eventually .
I been trying to find more survey sites .
Uh , yeah , I do n't know if they want us to stay on --
-- I guess they do want us to stay on the subject !
Oh well , the first time I done it , uh , we changed subjects a lot , me and the guy I was talking to the first time .
Yeah , the woman I had the first time , we did too , because she is in a town near where I grew up in Pennsylvania , so we were talking about stuff from there .
And then we started talking about all the different points programs and which ones she does and which ones I do and ...
Well , if I had your email address , I could send you a long list of survey sites .
Oh , well , that would be great , if you would n't mind .
Okay , that 'd work .
Okay , it 's T. --
