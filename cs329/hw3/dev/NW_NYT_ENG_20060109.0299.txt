Hempstead , N.Y .
-- It was n't the coldest thing that ever happened
in this auditorium .
The Jets ' official see-ya to Herman Edwards on Monday was an
emotional love fest compared with the way Bill Belichick got
out of Dodge five years earlier .
In fact , if the Jets had a sense of humor ( if
anybody in pro football had a sense of humor ) , they
would rename the room the HC of the NYJ Auditorium ,
in honor of Belichick , who performed his own personal quarterback
draw out of the Jets ' lives .
That 's correct .
X marks the spot where the winner of at
least three Super Bowls left the Jets flat-footed nearly five
years ago , after scribbling his resignation notes on a slip
of paper .
On this very same stage Monday , Jets General Manager Terry Bradway
bid a tepid adieu to Edwards , who had given five
years of energy , and a good bit of success , to
this franchise .
Later in the day , Edwards accepted the coaching
job in far-off Kansas City .
Bradway wished him luck , falling
somewhere between cheering and mourning .
It was pretty cold .
It sounded as if Edwards had wanted a longer and richer
contract , and as if the Jets ' owner , Woody Johnson , could
not wait to deliver an emphatic " no way ! " Bradway , who
is not a very public person , had to act like
a general manager , out in front of the news media
types Monday , to explain why Edwards was gone .
By Bradway 's own admission , never once , in the last weeks of
overt public negotiating and private leaks and demands , did he
say : " Herm , we want you here .
What will it take
to keep you ? "
Upon prodding Monday , Bradway said , " It may not have been the
right thing to do , " suggesting there is some kind of
guy code that keeps a general manager from trying to
persuade his coach to stick around .
That was cold , too .
Edwards hit the lucky-protege jackpot .
He is close with Carl Peterson ,
the Chiefs ' general manager , and Dick Vermeil , the retiring coach ,
each of whom wanted Edwards to go to work in
Kansas City .
Bradway also has Kansas City associations , but he
and the Jets seemed quite all right with waving goodbye
to Edwards .
" It 's like Parcells used to say , ' You can be in one
place too long , " ' Bradway said Monday , quoting Bill Parcells , who
hired him for the Jets ' front office and who has
profited from never staying in one place for long .
Change is good , Bradway said Monday , early and often .
He admitted
he was speaking of both the Chiefs and the Jets .
Edwards leaves with a 39-41 record with the Jets and
a 2-3 playoff record .
No other Jets coach had ever
taken the team to the playoffs three times .
This is not exactly one of the great franchises .
Under different
regimes , the Jets have watched Lou Holtz walk , have sacked
Pete Carroll after one year , have let Parcells bully Belichick
into leaving without ever coaching a game and have now
let Edwards go without trying to keep him .
It was possible to find fault with Edwards 's game management , and
with his dependence on past coordinators of his offense and
defense , but there was no missing his essential leadership .
Players
hustled for Edwards .
He was one of them , and he
was decent , and he spoke with gospel flair .
Heck , sportswriters would have played for Edwards .
In this same HC
of NYJ auditorium in the spring of 2001 , the new
coach held a full day of seminars for the Jets '
news media corps -- then he led us out on
the field for drills , just so we would know what
his cadre of coaches was doing .
I popped a hamstring
chasing a punt .
On chilly days I can feel it
twanging , a lasting memory of Herman Edwards .
Thanks , Coach .
Over the years , Edwards was not able to hide his insecurity
about money .
Whenever a coaching friend of his was fired
or threatened , Edwards would wax bitter about the vagaries of
his business .
It was plain to see he was thinking
about himself .
Now he was coming off a 4-12 season ,
with a bum-shouldered quarterback and an aging running back , and
he had only two years left on his contract , worth
about $ 4 million .
Edwards does not come from money .
One
more contract and he would be set for life .
He
understood that , but the owner , who does come from money ,
let him walk .
There is no suggestion that Edwards is going to win three
Super Bowls the way Belichick has .
Neither is there reason
to believe Bradway is about to create a dynasty with
the list of leftover coaches he is about to interview .
The Jets had a coach but they let him get
away .
That was cold , and quite possibly stupid .
