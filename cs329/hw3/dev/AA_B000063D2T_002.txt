I liked this fan so much I came back for another !
This fan has three settings , the lowest of which is great at night as it makes virtually no noise at all .
I use it in front of a window A/C unit to circulate the cool air between living and dining room and it does an outstanding job.At night I would carry it upstairs to do the same or just to keep the room cool on a non-A/C needed night , it 's very lightweight .
But with this great price , why ? !
Much better to get a second fan so I can have one on both floors at all times .
Easy to put together ,well made , great guarantee , nice color , easy to clean , quiet , lightweight and really is not your mother 's fan- this one truly circulates the air without a harsh direct breeze .
