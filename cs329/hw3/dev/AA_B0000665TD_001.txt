An excellent steamer for the money .
I had planned to buy a commercial grade model , but decided to buy this model instead since it only took 2 minutes to heat up versus 15 minutes or more for the commercial grade models .
This one is a much better quality than the one that I am replacing which I bought at a local department store at least 5 years ago .
These steamers pay for themselves by saving money on drycleaning billls .
Even if I pay my housekeeper to steam my clothes , she is able to steam 3 times as many clothes as she can iron in the same time period .
Like I said , this steamer is money well spent .
