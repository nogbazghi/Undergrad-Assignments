This is advertised as a HEPA filter however what is sent it a replacement HEPA-Type Filter !
The true HEPA filters for the Holmes tower unit which is shown in the picture has a white filter section not gray and filters down to .03
microns of particulate filtering 99.7 % of dirt and dust .
HEPA type only filter out 99 % .
Not a big deal you say ?
Well if you are an allergy prone person or have an asthmatic in your family this can be the difference between living with pets or no pets at all !
I hope AMAZON fixes this advertising flaw ASAP and actually starts selling the real HEPA filters !
