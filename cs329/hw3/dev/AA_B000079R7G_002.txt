We had a Generation Kirby Vacuum for about 20 years .
It seemed to work pretty good of course that thing cost us 1200.00 back than .
Well anyway , it had lost the suction and I knew that it was time to get a new vacuum .
I researched and have always wanted a Dyson basically because the reviews were so positive for the most part .
I looked and found the Dyson DC07 for 379.00 ( new ) .
I jumped on that deal and it was sent to the house .
Now to me , 379.00 was so much better than 1200.00
so I felt like I made a great choice !
I had no idea how great of a choice that I made until I used it for the first time .
Oh my goodness ... I only did a small portion and it really performed great .
It even sucked small particles from the depths of my carpet that I had no idea were there .
I could not wait until hubby came home .. I showed him the dirt that the vacumm had retrieved and even he was amazed !
Needless to say , he told me that I made a smart choice in getting the dyson !
It comes with all the attachments that you would ever need and they are not hard to change out !
I know that I was so impressed with this vacuum .
It performed better than I could ever have imagined .
It is a little heavy but not as heavy as the Kirby !
This vacuum is a keeper !
Thanks Dyson !
