I loved this book !
First off , instead of just coming along with the story which I 'm usually doing when reading a mystery , I felt myself echoing each choice made by the characters , often feeling as if I would speak in the same voice were I in that situation .
Gussin 's ability to place the reader within the plot in such a visceral , yet subtle way , is a true talent .
Her protagonist , Dr. Laura Nelson , is a real woman , who despite being a top thoracic surgeon , can be hurt just like any woman when she finds her husband cheating on her .
When the woman her husband cheated on her with is found dead , she 's accused of the murder , and to make matters worse , her husband thinks she did it .
While the backbone of the plot is the murder mystery , the story of her family being pulled apart and what she has to do to keep it together is the heart of the novel .
Gussin paints a layered portrait of how fragile happiness can be .
