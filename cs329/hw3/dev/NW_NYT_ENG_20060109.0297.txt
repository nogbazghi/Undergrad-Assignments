As Snoopy once said after falling off his
doghouse , " Life is full of rude awakenings . "
There 'll be one nine days from now when Camp Snoopy leaves
the Mall of America and takes the entire " Peanuts " gang
with him .
The Bloomington , Minn. , mall said Monday that several months of negotiations
over the " Peanuts " brands ended without an agreement , which means
the seven-acre amusement park will no longer be called Camp
Snoopy .
Mall officials said they had hoped to retain the name , given
that creator Charles Schulz was born and grew up in
the Twin Cities .
" It was part of Minnesota folklore , " said
Julie Hansen , a spokeswoman for the Mall of America .
" We 're
sad to see it go . "
Hansen said the mall hoped to find a new theme "in
the near future , " but visitors to the mall Monday said
they had a hard time imagining the amusement park without
Snoopy and the gang .
A huge , inflatable Snoopy stands at the center of the park ,
and children can ride with Snoopy in his World War
I biplane .
Surrounding the rides are a half-dozen shops that sell " Peanuts " dolls
and other merchandise .
Schulz is memorialized with a bench featuring
Snoopy and Woodstock sharing a cookie .
Patrick Adams , 5 , looked visibly sad Monday as his mother , Angela ,
explained to him that Snoopy was decamping .
" It looks like
he 's waving goodbye , " said Patrick , pointing up at the front
paw of the inflatable Snoopy .
The mall lost the right to use Camp Snoopy and the
" Peanuts " brands last March , after it took over management of
the giant indoor amusement park from Cedar Fair , a Sandusky ,
Ohio-based company that operates seven theme parks nationwide .
Cedar Fair has the exclusive right to use Snoopy and " Peanuts "
characters at its theme parks in the United States under
an arrangement with United Media , the New York licensing and
syndication agency for " Peanuts . "
Hansen , the mall spokeswoman , said the mall wanted to keep the
" Peanuts " theme alive , but it also wanted to promote the
park in key markets .
" It was one of the sticking
points " in negotiations over the use of the brand , Hansen
said .
" Cedar Fair would n't let us advertise the park the
way we wanted to or needed to in order to
promote the business . "
In a statement issued Monday , the Mall of America said it
was in negotiations with "exciting new brands " and expected to
make an announcement about the park "very soon . "
In the
interim , the park will be referred to as " The Park
at MOA " and will remain open .
All Camp Snoopy tickets
and coupons will remain valid .
The change comes at a time when Charlie Brown and friends
are undergoing something of a revival .
The animated television special ,
" A Charlie Brown Christmas , " attracted 15 million viewers on Dec.
6 , the most in the special 's 40-year history .
Advertisers paid
as much as $ 200,000 for each 30-second spot during the
special , which scored the highest ratings of any show on
the night it aired .
According to Forbes magazine , Schulz has become the second-most-profitable "dead celebrity , "
with only the estate of Elvis Presley collecting more .
In
2004 , the Charles M. Schulz Creative Associates earned about $ 35
million , largely from the sale of thematic clothing , toys and
stationery .
Camp Snoopy was particularly popular with tourists , who would often cite
Camp Snoopy as their primary reason for visiting the mall .
This summer , two Japanese tourists were married at the Mall
of America as part of a trip to Camp Snoopy .
Mall officials said crews will work after hours to remove the
" Peanuts " memorabilia by Jan . 19 .
Most of the rides will
not be affected by the change because they are n't connected
directly to a Snoopy theme .
" There are more than 30 rides , lots of food and plenty
of things to do , " Hansen said .
