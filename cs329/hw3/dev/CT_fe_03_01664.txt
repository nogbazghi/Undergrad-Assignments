I 've seen -- yeah , I 've seen several that she 's had .
But did you see the one of Saddam Hussein ?
It was really interesting .
Was it showing the castles and --
Um , yeah .
-- his palaces and --
Yeah .
And she talked about how he really thought Hitler was a great person .
Yeah , right .
It was , ah , you know , when I was watching this I thought , " Oh , my word " .
I had -- had absolutely no idea .
He describes the word masochist and +sadist .
Yes .
And a few other things .
Ah , I do n't think the man or his sons , any of 'em , I think they were loony tunes actually .
Yeah .
And it 's -- it 's , I do n't know .
It 's hard to say how they got that way .
I do n't know .
His -- his -- even his -- the one wife was saying what a horrible person he was and stuff and --
Oh , really ?
Yeah , yeah .
Wow .
So it 's -- it 's -- you know , the people lived in fear of him .
And , oh my God , every t- every place you looked there was a picture of the man .
Yes , that was -- that was a little bit of a --
I mean , did n't he get tired of looking at himself ?
He apparently had , um , a TV -- the TV station had to have his favorite things on every day .
They 'd have to have either his favorite kinds of music or , um , you know , different cultural art things that he enjoyed .
It had to be on , um , yeah , every day .
And he had to have his picture on the front page of the paper every day .
Is n't that sad ?
And it , you know , m - makes you wonder how somebody gets to be like that , you know ?
And , you know , you se- -- the kids -- how many generation - -- you know , he 's been in power , what , forty years ?
Yeah .
How many generations have been raised to believe that this is okay and worshipping him is -- is okay ?
And th - that 's because they do n't know any better .
They do n't know they do n't have to .
Right .
So , it 's just , mm , just makes my skin crawl .
Oh , how lucky --
-- we are to be raised here .
Yes .
Yes , we are , definitely lucky .
Yeah , very lucky .
When you see something like that we know how lucky we are .
So -- and I just -- I do n't know , I think George Bush is doing a good job of it .
He is , he is .
I -- I , ah , was n't real sure how he was going to handle things but I think he 's -- he 's doing good things [inaudible] .
