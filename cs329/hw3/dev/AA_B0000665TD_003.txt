This steamer is everything I hoped it would be .
I had been using a small portable hand-held model for about a year , creeping along with only being able to steam maybe 3 articles of clothing at a time before having to stop & refill .
I finally decided to spring for one of these after reading reviews & researching different models .
What an amazing purchase !
I can do a whole weeks worth of wardrobe for my businessman husband at a time without stopping !
It 's actually fun to do now & I look forward to this 'chore ' .
Very user friendly , I do n't have one negative thing to say about it , this Jiffy works like a charm !
My husband knew how agrivated i 'd get trying to steam his clothes with the little one , so the first time he saw me using this one , I kept exclaiming over & over how easier it was & how better it worked & how much I loved it , ..he did n't even gripe about the cost !
