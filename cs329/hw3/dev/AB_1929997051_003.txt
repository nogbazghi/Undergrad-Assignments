Having been a convert of Dr Sarno 's mind-body approach for over a year , I purchased the workbook thinking it would take me to a new level of implementing Sarno 's concepts .
Hardly !
I found the workbook far less useful than the recommendation in Sarno 's Divided Mind book and terribly overpriced for what it provided .
