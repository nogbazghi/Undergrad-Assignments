Bush went to a school today .
Well , if at first you donât succeed ...
It was the Harlem Village Academy Charter School , which he says is a âschool where a child looks at the President and says , I donât mind being tested , because I know that theyâre going to help correct problems early , before itâs too late .â 
Iâm sure one of the children really said exactly those words to him .
Iâve said before how obnoxious I find that âbefore itâs too lateâ  thing , how insulting to people in adult literacy programs , learning to read in prisons , etc .
I mean , GeeDubya is 60 , and what is the following line if not a hidden cry for help : â When student struggle , they receive one-on-one tutoring during the school day .â 
He said âSchools should be places of safety .â 
Which is why he brought a whole bunch of guys with guns with him .
The purpose of the trip was to call for the reauthorization of No Child Left Behind .
He talked in a softly bigoted way about the soft bigotry of low expectations : â I have come to a school where some may say these children canât possibly exceed high standardsâ .
The centerpiece of NCLB ?
Choice .
â I like to be able to sit with parents and say , I have chose school for my child -- chosen the school for my child ...â 
His word of the day was herald : âSee , I love it when somebody heralds that which is working and takes on that which is not working .â 
âso a good way to herald National Charter School Week is come to a charter schoolâ .
âthe President has an opportunity to herald excellence , and I have seized that opportunity .â 
Some of his other faves : There were 14 âin other words ,â  including â In other words , it matters what happens now in our schools , more so than ever beforeâ  and â In other words , there ought to be flexibility -- more flexibility as opposed to less flexibility when a school failsâ  and âSo I said to a lot of the kids here at this school , how many of you want to go to college ?
They all rose -- raised their hand .
Thatâs a good sign .
In other words , this school believes in high expectations and putting in a childâs mind the possibilities of achieving a dream .â 
And a death-defying double âin other wordsâ : â In other words , something has changed here at this school .
In other words , there is progress being madeâ .
He found 7 things âinteresting , â  including that a student asked why heâd come , and â Interestingly enough , this week is called National Charter School Week -- I mean , next week is called National Charter School Week , so a good way to herald National Charter School Week is come to a charter schoolâ .
And something or other about tailoring was interesting : âThe data from this school that you -- as a result of measurement helps teachers tailor their lesson plans to the specific needs of the child .
Isnât that interesting ?
The education system tailoring the needs to fit the -- tailor the curriculum to fit the needs of the child ?
That may sound simple , but itâs an unusual concept for a lot of schools .â 
I think I can honestly say that that did nât sound simple .
And a two-fer : â I appreciate the results of this school .
In other words , itâs interesting , is nât it , that the President can come and say you âve got good results here -- because you measure .â 
And if you donât want to measure , you hate America .
Or at least âcertainâ  children .
âNow , if you believe certain children canât learn , then you should nât measure .â 
He wants to extend NCLB to high schools .
â I believe if you want to make sure a high school diploma means something , you better have high accountability in high schools .â 
And how did George spend high school ?
High .
â I canât think of a better way to get somebodyâs attention that weâre tired of mediocrity than to give a parent an option .â 
Really , George , you canât think , period .
Hereâs a thought you never expected to hear from George W. Bush : âIf you find failure , itâs important to do something differently .â 
A Texas oil manâs view of schools : âThe pipeline is beginning to be full of little readers that are competent readers .â 
Maybe that âs what he means about reaching children before itâs too late .
No Child Left Stuck in the Pipeline .
