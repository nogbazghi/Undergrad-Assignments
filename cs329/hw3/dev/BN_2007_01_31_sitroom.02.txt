Thank you .
Nancy Pelosi .
You saw Congressman John Murtha there , as well , one of the major critics of the president 's Iraq strategy .
They were all over at the White House today .
They 've just returned from a visit to Iraq , Pakistan and Afghanistan .
And we 'll continue to follow up on this story .
Coming up , the Republican divide over more troops for Iraq .
I 'll talk about it with Senator Lindsey Graham and ask him how his position might impact his reelection campaign , among other subjects .
Plus , exposure at ground zero -- did it sicken , did it even kill people and animals ?
We 're going to show you why some say yes .
Stay with us .
We 'll be right back .
To our viewers , thanks very much for joining us .
You 're in THE SITUATION ROOM , where new pictures and information are arriving all the time .
Happening now , President Bush making a spur of the moment visit to the New York Stock Exchange , the first such trip by a sitting president in more than two decades .
He greeted people on the trading floor and told our own Susan Lisovicz he was impressed and grateful for the warm reception .
Also , Senator Joe Biden joining the race for the White House , filing papers to open his presidential campaign .
The Delaware Democrat saying on his Web site he 's running , above all else , he says , because of what he calls President Bush 's failures in Iraq .
And likely candidate Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton canceling much of her weekend trip to the key primary state of New Hampshire .
Her campaign says it 's because former President Bill Clinton 's stepfather is sick and adds she looks forward to rescheduling her visit to the Granite State .
I 'm Wolf Blitzer .
You 're in THE SITUATION ROOM.
As we just saw , the president has met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders who are just back from Baghdad .
Pelosi indicates there are some areas of agreement , but the Bush administration is still battling Congress over a new strategy for Iraq .
Can the United States count on Iraq , though , to hold up its end of the bargain ?
And joining us now from Capitol Hill , Senator Lindsey Graham , Republican of South Carolina .
He 's been a firm supporter of the president 's proposal to increase the number of troops going over to Iraq .
So much of this plan depends on Nouri Al-Maliki , the prime minister of Iraq .
Do you trust this guy ?
I think he 's come to the conclusion that the best hope for the Shia population in Iraq is to live in peace with Sunnis and Kurds and not to be a puppet of Iran , so I trust him to pursue what he believes to be in the best interests of the Shia people in Iraq .
And I think that is a political settlement with Sunnis and Kurds , under the rule of law , not the rule of guns , but I 'm going to verify , just not trust .
Trust , but verify , in the words of a former U.S. president .
Yes , right .
He told our Michael Ware , Nouri al-Maliki , in an exclusive interview in Baghdad earlier today , that he wants the United States and Iran to take their so-called proxy war out of Iraq .
In effect , he was delivering what some would call moral equivalence , dictating to the United States and to the Iranians to simply get out of his country and fight their war someplace else .
