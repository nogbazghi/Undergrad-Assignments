And third , the DNA .
The movie and novel " The Da Vinci Code " suggests that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were secretly married , with a child .
And astoundingly , Cameron 's researchers insist one of the caskets says it contains the son of Jesus .

Like the Shroud of Turin , this tomb has been surrounded with questions since it was discovered in 1980 .
There are a lot of questions here , but the answers do not point in the direction that these are the bones of Jesus .

So how did Wall Street 's biggest buyout deal become environmentally friendly ?
It 's 25 minutes past the hour , which means it 's time for Ali Velshi who is " Minding Your Business " .
Good morning .
Good morning .
This was the deal to buy out the big Texas utility , TXU.
Let me show you how this deal did actually became environmentally friendly .
It was the biggest deal announced , but before announcing the deal to buy out TXU , the buyers got together with a couple of environmental groups and won their support .
How did they do that ?
They announced they 'd scrap plans to build eight out of 11 coal-fired plants that TXU had planned to build .
That was going to save 56 million tons of carbon emissions a year .
It 's a trend that 's catching on .
If you want to be as green as TXU , you can become part of a more consumer trend we 've been following .
You offset your carbon footprint .
In other words , you pay money to support some activity that neutralizes the carbon emissions that you personally contribute to .
Some examples of that include driving a car , using disposable diapers , traveling by plane .
A number of small companies have started up .
You can pay them money to undertake activities that offset your pollution , basically .
Critics say it might have the effect of actually allowing people to go on with their energy sucking behavior , with a clear conscience .
But it is catching on .
And we 've been reporting this morning that Al Gore 's big house is partially green .
Gore produced bills that showed he purchased 108 blocks of green power for each of the past 3 months .
It 's worth about 432 bucks a month extra , he paid for to use solar or other energy sources coming into his house .
One group says that 's about the equivalent of recycling 2.5 million aluminum cans , or more than a quarter million pounds of newspapers .
So it might be a trend that folks want to take advantage of , Soledad .
