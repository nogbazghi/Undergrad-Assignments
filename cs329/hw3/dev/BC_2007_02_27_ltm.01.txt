Now developing news about the vice president 's trip to Afghanistan .
He was quickly ushered to a bomb shelter in the midst of an apparent assassination attempt .
It happened at the sprawling U.S. airbase at Bagram .
At least three dead , including an American soldier .
Let 's get right to CNN 's Elaine Quijano at the White House .
Elaine , any official word from the White House about this ?
Reporter : Well , you know , the word we are getting is from the vice president himself , Miles , talking to reporters who are traveling with him .
By all accounts , the vice president was not close to the area where this explosion at Bagram Air Base actually took place , but he did tell those reporters who were with him that he certainly heard a loud boom while he was at Bagram Airbase in Afghanistan .
He said that the Secret Service told him that there had been an attack on the main gate and then he was moved for a brief period of time to a bomb shelter near his quarters before he was allowed to return to his room .
Now the vice president was asked about reports that the Taliban not only claimed responsibility for this attack , but also bluntly saying that Vice President Cheney himself was the target .
The vice president responded by saying , quote , " I think they clearly try to find ways to question the authority of the central government .
Striking at the Bagram base with a suicide bomber , I suppose , is one way to do that .
It should n't affect our behavior . "
But this attack , Miles , coming more than five years after U.S. forces toppled the Taliban in Afghanistan .
America 's allies in the region , as you noted , Afghanistan and Pakistan , have been unsuccessful in curbing the threat posed by al Qaeda and the Taliban .
Mr. Cheney met in Afghanistan with Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , to talk about that threat , and away from the cameras to no doubt press him to do more .
Senior officials saying that there is still a lot of work that needs to be done -- Miles .
Elaine Quijano at the White House , thank you -- Soledad .

Hey , Elizabeth , good morning .
Good morning , Soledad .
Soledad , for this story , we spoke with a woman name Natalie who would go on wild food binges , eating ice cream , potato chips , cookies , and more .
A sleeve of Ritz crackers with peanut butter , Triscuits , you know , some cheese from the refrigerator , maybe some cream cheese straight out of the carton , maybe some mayonnaise right out of the jar .
For more than 10 years , Natalie lived in shame .
And I would buy foods from , you know , from different stores and stop in different places so that nobody would , you know , would know that I was getting -- no one could really track me .
I really needed to be anonymous in my eating .
