" South Beach " ( UPN ; 8 tonight -- two-hour premiere )
Logline : Jennifer Lopez serves as an executive producer on this glossy
soap featuring lots of bikini-clad beauties and brooding hunks lounging
and clubbing around Miami Beach .
Brooklyn buddies Matt ( Marcus Coloma )
and Vincent ( Chris Johnson ) head south to see Matt 's ex ,
Arielle ( Odette Yustman ) , an aspiring model dating a hip club
manager ( Lee Thompson Young ) .
Matt takes a job working security
at the club -- !ital !that 'll be awkward -- while Vincent
hooks up with a thug ( Giancarlo Esposito ) whose essential untrustworthiness
is conveyed by the fat cigar he lights up in
his first close-up .
They 're all interconnected through beachfront hotel owner
Elizabeth ( Vanessa Williams ) , who likes her men young : Matt , beware .
Pros : There 's no end to the lingering shots over female anatomy ,
1 or 2 percent of it almost necessary to the
plot .
Cons : There may be humans who just might behave like these
characters , but few of us are ever likely to encounter
them .
Luckily .
Arielle , for example , gets miffed with Matt for
preventing a shootout during a fashion show , and the guys
pretty much have to beat the women off with a
stick .
Which almost makes sense when Elizabeth warns Arielle --
need we say it ?
-- " South Beach will eat you
alive . "
In a nutshell : " This is such a different life than where
I 'm from , you would n't believe it , " Arielle marvels .
Actually , we
would believe it .
Even a video shoot/party goes loopily awry
when a rap star 's favorite bullet goes missing and a
moody supermodel goes bonkers .
" South Beach " is so deliriously overwrought ,
it can make " The O.C. " seem nuanced by comparison , but
that 's obviously part of its appeal .
