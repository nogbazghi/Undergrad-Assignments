Former Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet says that the âenhanced interrogationâ  of prisoners â  which he says is not the same as torture , but wonât say in what way it differs â  provided more intel than the FBI , CIA and NSA put together .
Tune in to 60 Minutes Sunday to find out if that means our enhanced interrogators are really , really good , or that the FBI , CIA and NSA are really , really bad .
In an interview with Larry King , John McCain called for Alberto Gonzales to resign to restore the integrity of the Justice Dept .
Okay , no he did nât , he said he should leave out of âloyalty to the president .â 
Wasnât appointing someone whose only qualification was loyalty to the president exactly the problem with Gonzales in the first place ?
Asked what happens if the âsurgeâ  does nât work , McMaverick said , â Well , I canât worry about it .
I donât think about it .â 
Maybe he can put that on his bumper stickers .
Wasnât a refusal to think about what would happen if everything did nât go exactly according to plan exactly the problem with the Iraq war in the first place ?
Asked about Don Imus , McCain said , â I believe in redemption .
I believe in forgiveness .
And I -- I forgave my North Vietnamese captors , who did nât treat me very well .
I forgave the anti-war movement and reconciled with them .â 
Larry King did not ask him about his remarks in 2000 : â I hated the gooks .
I will hate them as long as I live .â 
He was against forgiveness before he was for it .
He said several times that he was âdisappointedâ  with Harry Reid , adding , â But to declare the war lost , then I think itâs incumbent upon Senator Reid to say who won .
Is that al Qaeda ?
Is that the militia ?
Is that -- is that the forces of terrorism and radical Islamic extremism that are dedicated to destroying the United States of America ?â  Iâm not sure by what logic Reid needs to say who won , except that McCain wants to implicate Reid in some way for losing the war simply because he pointed out the fact that it has in fact been lost .
As does Joe Lieberman , who writes in an op-ed piece in the WaPo , â When politicians here declare that Iraq is âlostâ  in reaction to al-Qaedaâs terrorist attacks and demand timetables for withdrawal , they are doing exactly what al-Qaeda hopes they will do , although I know that is not their intent .â 
I think Holy Joe shows a true generosity of spirit in suggesting that Harry Reid is only an unwitting dupe of Al Qaida .
NATO is holding talks with the Russian foreign minister about our plan to base Star Wars systems in eastern Europe .
So naturally right before those talks start , Condi called Russian concerns âpurely ludicrous .â 
Our chief diplomat , ladies and gentlemen , our chief diplomat .
