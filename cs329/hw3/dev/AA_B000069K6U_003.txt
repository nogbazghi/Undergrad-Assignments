I 've owned and used this product for several years , primarily for pet "accidents " , with good results .
It has never clogged up or quit spraying as many reviewers have experienced .
However the way the hose wraps around and clips to the unit is poorly designed .
It required the hose to be bent at a sharp angle just below the nozzle while stored .
This caused the hose to prematurely break at that point .
Copious duct tape provides a temporary repair , enough for a few more uses , before separating again .
The design should be altered to avoid acutely bending the hose while the unit is not in use .
Also , the brush barely turns once it picks up any debris such as dog hair .
Otherwise , I have been satisfied with my Little Green Proheat Turbobrush .
