Iran once again this week told the world to take a hike and to stop interfering with its nuclear program .
And next door , Iraq is caught in a deadly whirlwind of Shia versus Sunni violence .
I spoke to Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist Seymour Hersh just a short time ago .
He is in Cairo .
He has a story coming out in the new issue of The New Yorker magazine about how the Pentagon is right now in the midst of intensive planning for a bombing campaign against Iran .
And joining us now from Cairo , Sy Hersh .
The article entitled , " The Redirection . "
Sy , let me read one line from it .
You wrote , " The Iran planning group has been handed a new assignment , to identify targets in Iran that may be involved in supplying or aiding militants in Iraq .
Previously , the focus had been on the destruction of Iran 's nuclear facilities and possible regime change . "
Based on all your reporting , how far along are U.S. military plans for a war with Iran ?
Well , of course , they 're very far along .
They have been studying this forever .
They 're constantly redesigning , retooling , but right now , as I wrote , look , it 's pretty obvious what 's going on .
