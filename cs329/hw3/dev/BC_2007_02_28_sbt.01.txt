Is that not going to have some kind of profound effect on them ?
It`ll have more an effect on Dannielynn because she does n` t know her mom ; she`ll never get to know her mom .
So the only images she`ll have are these images of her being not the best role model as a mom .
You know , we do n` t really know pictures of her where she` s sane and looking good , and all the videos of her of being a little nutty .
That` s all she has .
Whereas Britney Spears` kids have a chance to get to know their mom separate .
And we`re hoping that those images of - of their mom and that - that image of their mom will be - will be a picture for them , more so then if they actually have to see their mom without underwear .
Yes , because there are some positive images out there , I would say certainly the ratio of positive images to negative images on Britney probably better than that of - of Anna Nicole Smith .
You look at what happened over in Great Britain , when the princes were born , William and Harry .
There was sort of this unwritten rule with the paparazzi and - and of course , the tabloids are so big there - but they kind of agreed to leave the kids alone until they were 18 years old .
Do you think in the case of Jaden and Sean Preston Spears , and do you think in the case of - of Dannielynn that could ever quite possibly happen here in the states ?
Yes , and no .
I - I would n` t want to see a law to that effect , because I` m such a big supporter of the First Amendment .
But in terms of a general agreement , I think there is a little bit of that in general already .
Most magazines wo n` t just print a picture of a celebrity` s child at the playground .
But when a celebrity becomes such a big news story and that child is part of a news story , then there` s a little bit of a gray area .
But I`d like to see people really give these kids their privacy , because they have n` t asked for this , and they need a little bit of a shot to have a normal life .
Yes , and - and the parents should n` t have to work so hard to protect them , and they should n` t have to move to another part of the world .
I - I try to see the upside of this .
I only have about 30 seconds left .
But is there a chance that the kids will grow up and say , ` Wow , look how wacky my parents were .
OK , I` m not going to be like that ,` and actually turn out kind of normal .
Absolutely , and that` s the reason why , because they see how wacky their moms are , and they go , ` I do n` t want to be that kid .`
Also , their innate personality could be the kind of personalities that they just do n` t end up that way .
