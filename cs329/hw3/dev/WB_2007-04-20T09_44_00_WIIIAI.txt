Russia is building a floating nuclear power plant .
Gee , what a good idea , why did nât we think of that ?
Russia plans to sell them to other countries .
Secretary of War Robert Gates ( Iâm officially dumping the little pictures of gates â  live with it ) , on a âsurpriseâ  visit to Iraq , visited Fallujah , the city on which the US shat from a great height , to gush about the âreally good news storyâ  in Anbar province : âItâs a place where the Iraqis have decided to take control of their future .
The Sheiks have played a key role in making good things happen out here , along with the Iraqi police and the Iraqi army and with our help .â 
That âdecided to take control of their futureâ  line is the perfect combination of condescending paternalism and empty-headed corporate-management-speak .
Gen . Petraeus admits that Wednesday , with its âsensational attacks ,â  was âa bad day .â 
Itâs that sort of realism that makes him such a breath of fresh air .
He adds , âAnd a day like that can have a real psychological impact .â 
Yes , because if you were to characterize the sort of impact made by the deaths of 200 to 300 people in bombings , you would definitely say âpsychological .â 
He said that Al Qaida is âtrying to reignite sectarian violence , â  although he did not say when it was ever unignited ( disignited ? )
