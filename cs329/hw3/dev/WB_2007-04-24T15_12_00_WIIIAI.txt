The Bushies are trying to make Harry Reid , who is so harmless that he may be made entirely out of nerf , into a hate figure .
Today , Cheney spoke to the press about Reidâs âdefeatism .â 
Cheney speculated about the motives that could be behind such dark deeds : âMaybe itâs a political calculation .
Some Democratic leaders seem to believe that blind opposition to the new strategy in Iraq is good politics .
Senator Reid himself has said that the war in Iraq will bring his party more seats in the next election .
It is cynical to declare that the war is lost because you believe it gives you political advantage .
Leaders should make decisions based on the security interests of our country , not on the interests of their political party .â 
Note the rhetorical slide there : he starts from âmaybeâ  itâs political calculation so that he never makes the accusation directly , but every subsequent sentence is predicated on the assumption of political calculation .
Reid responded , âIâm not going to get into a name-calling match with the administration âs chief attack dog , â  which is technically species-calling rather than name-calling .
For some reason , he failed to respond to the implied claim that he does nât really believe that the war in Iraq is lost and is just claiming that it is for party political advantage .
I think he should take a lie detector test , donât you ?
Up next : Cheney accuses Reid of hating dogs .
