DAYTONA BEACH - Dale Earnhardt Jr. broke up a successful race
team to save a relationship with his cousin that was
already coming apart .
Last season , he and Tony Eury Jr.
had to put both back together to save a Nextel
Cup season crumbling to pieces .
As the competitive and combustible Earnhardt and Eury Jr. begin their
first full season as NASCAR 's most scrutinized driver and crew
chief , they believe that their humbling , introspective 2005 has made
them better racers and relatives .
If so , they might save
a Dale Earnhardt Inc. team that finds itself at a
defining juncture .
And it all started with a typically concise conversation between a
pair who had learned to anticipate each other 's thoughts by
playing and racing with and against each other since they
were toddlers .
" Midway '05 , we got together and I asked him pointblank , " Earnhardt
remembers . " I said , " Do you ever want to work with
me again in the future ?
Not just '06 , any time ? '
and he said , " Yep. '
" I said , " When do you want to do that ?
We can
do it next year if you want ' and he said ,
" Yep , sounds good to me . '
And he said some things
he would n't normally say and that he really had a
lot of confidence in my abilities and that 's something he
would never say before .
We talked about how we respected
each other 's abilities .
That was the defining moment , if there
was one . "
It was a long route between cousins having fun working their
way to NASCAR 's highest level , from being separated because they
could not get along , to their reunion in the final
10 races of 2005 .
Eury Jr. served as Earnhardt 's car
chief through his entire Busch series and Nextel Cup career
before he was promoted to crew chief for Michael Waltrip 's
No.
15 Chevrolet team before last season .
DEI contended that
Waltrip and Earnhardt 's teams were swapped to make both competitive ,
but Earnhardt made it clear it was because of he
and his cousin .
Though Eury Jr. technically ranked under his namesake father and crew
chief while working for Earnhardt before 2005 , he gradually assumed
more decisionmaking responsibility .
Earnhardt won twice and finished third in
points in 2003 and he won six more times to
finish fifth in 2004 , but internal conflicts had grown so
bad between he and his cousin that they stopped talking
while at Homestead for the season finale .
So the teams
were shaken up .
Richie Gilmore , DEI 's director of motorsports ,said he
could sense the swap and appointment of Pete Rondeau as
Earnhardt 's crew chief would fail almost immediately but said , " When
you make the decision , you have to stand by it
and just see how it plays out ."
Rondeau was replaced as Earnhardt 's crew chief after 11 races by
team technical director Steve Hmiel , who led until Eury Jr.
was moved back when Earnhardt failed to qualify for the
Chase for the Championship .
Though Earnhardt finished a career-worst 19th in points in 2005 , Gilmore
said the results could ultimately be measured in chemistry , not
statistics .
" I think it was a chance worth taking , and I think
it will pay off down the road because I think
if we would have kept things the way they were ,
it was going to blow up eventually , " he said .
Eury Jr. said he and his cousin had begun to take
each other for granted after working together for so long .
They are completely different people now , he said , from that
weekend in Homestead .
" It 's hard to explain what the difference is , " Eury Jr. said .
" We 're two different people now for sure .
I think he
kind of sees from my standpoint what I have to
deal with on my end .
I kind of got out
from underneath ( my father 's ) wing and became a crew chief
myself and I did n't see ( that ) when he 's gone .
I
know what we miss in that aspect . "
Though they are almost sure to clash again at some point
in the future under the pressure of scrutiny , they seem
to be enjoying the peace for now .
And each other 's
company .
" It feels good going to the shop and talking to Tony
Jr.
and hear him talking about the cars and knowing
when he 's talking about his cars , he 's talking about my
cars , too , " Earnhardt Jr. said .
