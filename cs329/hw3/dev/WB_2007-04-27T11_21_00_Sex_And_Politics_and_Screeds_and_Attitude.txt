into the gonzales ' cesspool , this is from dan eggen 's article in the washington post :
In a letter sent last night to the Senate and House Judiciary committees , Justice gave a list of 171 documents it is withholding from Congress because they involve " congressional and media inquiries " about the dismissals , seven of which occurred Dec. 7.
this is from the ap :
The U.S. attorney in Arkansas warned the Justice Department five months before he and seven federal prosecutors were fired that 'there may be some stink about this down the road ' - in part because of White House involvement . 'The
White House recently called our sole Republican congressman ( Boozman ) and pretty much told him what they are doing with this appointment and how they are going about it , ' then-Arkansas U.S. Attorney Bud Cummins wrote in a July 6 , 2006 , e-mail to Mike Battle , then-head of the Justice Department office that oversees federal prosecutors .
Cummins ' reference was to Rep. John Boozman , R-Ark .Cummins knew by then that he was going to be dismissed and replaced by a White House appointee who turned out to be Tim Griffin , a protege of Karl Rove , President Bush 's top political adviser .
His e-mail was in previously unreleased documents sent Friday by the Justice Department to the House and Senate Judiciary committees .
okay , that 's it for me .
here 's c.i . 's ' Iraq snapshot : '
Friday , April 27 , 2007 .
Chaos and violence continue , another prisoner in Iraq dies in US custody , the death of 3 US service members are announced , Riverbend and her family decide it 's time to leave Iraq , students continue their activism in the US , and more .
Starting with war resisters , Richard Brown ( KXLY ) profiles war resister Ryan Johnson who self-checked out in 2005 and went to Canada with his wife Jenny to seek asylum .
Johnson states , " I decided that I did n't want to participate in what I preceived to be an illegal war .
I have no problem serving my country .
I love the United States .
That 's where I grew up , that 's my home , that 's where my family is . "
Death of the party Lizzie Knudson shows up to puff out her chest and strut like any macho b.s .
artist while expressing her hate and rage by declaring that she hopes he 's thrown in prison for life and that she knows people who have died in Iraq .
Pass that rage on over to the Bully Boy , Lizzie , Ryan Johnson did n't send anyone into an illegal war to die .
Had Brown spent less time offering Lizzie 's rants , he might have been able to provide some actual information ( and it would have pleased War Hawk Liz ) .
He could have , for instance , noted that the Johnsons share a home in Canada with
Kyle Snyder and Maleah Friesen .
The latter are now married .
Of course their planned February wedding got put on hold when Canadian police -- taking orders from the US military -- showed up at the home to drag Snyder away in handcuffs ( and in his boxers -- would n't even let him get dressed ) with the intent to start immediate deportation on Snyder .
That 's a story that would have tickled War Hawk Lizzie even if it has Canadians outraged ( whether they support war resisters or not ) because ( a ) war resistance is not a deportable offense and ( b ) the Canadian police is not supposed to take orders from a foreign government .
The US media continues its silence on that event and also avoids noting that US military crossed over into Canada on a search for war resister Joshua Key . Brown does note , " In the last seven years , nearly 22,500 member of the United States military have gone AWOL or deserted and every year the numbers rise . "
