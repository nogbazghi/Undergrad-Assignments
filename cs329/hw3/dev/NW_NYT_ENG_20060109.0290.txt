Even with the changes , BET 's new team has no intention of
abandoning its core 18-to-34 , largely male , audience .
Music videos will
still make up a large portion of the programming schedule .
Johnson over the years has responded to the company 's critics with
indignation , dismissing many complaints about the lyrics and images in
hip-hop videos as supercilious intellectual posturing .
" People that deem themselves
to be intellectuals felt it important to criticize BET , " he
said in an interview .
" But you take any artist who
appears on BET and take them to the NAACP or
Urban League convention and you have everybody in the whole
convention up and down cheering . "
Lee , too , bats down criticism , though in more measured tones .
" We 're
not PBS , and we 'll never be PBS , " she said .
But the channel will aim to reach its base with more
breadth and creativity , while also trying to woo new viewers ,
executives said .
One of the channel 's new programs is " Lil ' Kim : Countdown to
Lockdown , " a six-episode reality series about the last two weeks
in the life of the raunchy female rapper before she
began a one-year prison sentence in September for perjury linked
to a shooting between rival hip-hop camps .
Another reality series , " Season of the Tiger , " chronicles the achievements and
pressures of football players and band members at Grambling State
University , a historically black school in Louisiana .
" Meet the Faith " is a savvy effort to provide an alternative
to Sunday-morning news talk shows often criticized for not including
enough black opinion makers .
As part of its rethinking of
news coverage , the channel is planning more news-magazine-style programming on
current events .
It recently had a special on the execution
of Stanley Tookie Williams as well as one following the
death of the comedian Richard Pryor .
Hudlin , 44 , said that Lee has yet to say no to
him .
" So far she has been incredibly enthusiastic and supportive
of every crazy idea that has come out of my
mouth , " he said .
For Lee , the daughter of an Army tank driver and a
hospital ward clerk , who earned degrees at Brown University and
Harvard Law School , her new role is the culmination of
a steady , and largely low-key , ascent over nearly 20 years
with the cable company , which she joined in 1986 as
a vice president and general counsel .
While cycling through a series of executive posts , Lee also became
a trusted nuts-and-bolts , go-to person for Johnson .
She selected the
site for company 's headquarters on a 10-acre stretch of land
surrounding a former meat-packing plant in Northwest Washington and oversaw
its building .
The night before the company went public in 1991 , Johnson said ,
Lee stood at the printer late into the night , personally
copying the public offering documents , then took the first flight
to New York the next morning for the opening bell
at the New York Stock Exchange .
Generally reserved and unassuming , Lee possesses a rebellious streak .
She took
Chinese studies while studying political science at Brown , largely because
of the Black Power movement 's fascination with Communist ideology at
