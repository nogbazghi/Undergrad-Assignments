The Wet/Dry kit works great and was produced with a higher quality material than I imagined .
I was also leary about buying from Amazon and using the free shipping but , the kit shipped within two days and arrived within five days .
All in all , shopping at Amazon could n't be easier and the Fein Wet/Dry kit is worth every penny .
