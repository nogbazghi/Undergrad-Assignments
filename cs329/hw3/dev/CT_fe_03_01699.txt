Well --
I do n't really think this had anything to do with it .
I may be naive , but , ah , I think Israel 's a separate issue --
Yeah .
-- and I think they keep trying to bring it in , but --
Well , everyone likes to tie everything to something else .
Oh , ai n't that the truth .
Yeah .
You know , I mean , --
I think they 're both pigheaded myself .
You know , it 's like , " Can't you all just work together " , yeah .
Of course --
No.
-- I feel that way about Republicans and Democrats , so --
Yeah , yeah , I know .
Oh .
It 's kind of crazy .
It is .
And all the -- the , um , the , um , actors and actresses .
Oh .
They 're about to drive me crazy .
Ain't it the truth .
It 's ridiculous .
I know it .
And --
I --
-- it --
-- you know , they have such unreal lives , you know , I just --
They -- it 's -- I do n't know .
They 're -- and , and I do n't think that they 're -- they should -- it 's not their place to talk about it , you know what I mean ?

I know .
And , um , I just think that 's kinda funny .
Yeah .
Well , they think -- they 're so used to being made stars of that --
Right .
-- you know I guess they expect everybody to think like they do too .
I do n't know .
It 's ...
But I do n't think it 's very smart .
I know that if I was an entertainer that relied on the public 's view of me , I would not take sides on anything in as , as far as voicing my opinions .
Mhm .
Because you alienate so many people when you do that .
Well , that 's true .
But then you ca n't just not stand for anything .
I do n't know .
Yeah .
But I think there 's a time and a place for it .
Exactly .
You know .
I mean , I do n't know , I think that there 's just , um , -- I do n't know .
It just seems , like , I would wanna -- so many of them are always saying that they want to keep their personal lives personal --
