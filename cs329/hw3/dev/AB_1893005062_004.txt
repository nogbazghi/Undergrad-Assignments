When I first got this book , my blood sugar had leveled-out at about 300.
I just could n't lower my blood sugar , no matter how well I ate or how much I exercised .
All my doctor could or would do was change my medication and order more tests for me .
I did n't have medical insurance and I could n't afford any more tests , or even doctors ' visits ; so I stopped seeing my doctor .<br>
In this book , I was firmly advised NOT to exercise until my blood sugar was below 250 ; otherwise my body would react to the exercise by releasing even more sugar into my blood .
After I stopped the exercise my blood sugar did start to slowly drop .
I then carefully read the book from cover to cover , and gained a large amount of very useful information .<br>
I also began doing " Tai Chi for Diabetes " , which also appears to have helped .<br>
Within a few weeks my blood sugar level dropped below 110 .
I then discontinued the medication my doctor had given me .
For over a week now my blood sugar has been below 107 ; without taking any pills .<br>
I 've read a few other books on Diabetes , and they were all somewhat helpful ; but " The Mayo Clinic on Managing Diabetes " was by far the most helpful and informative book I 've read on the subject .
I strongly recommend it .
