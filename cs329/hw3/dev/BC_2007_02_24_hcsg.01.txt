HIV and AIDS is associated with conduct or behavior that is considered to be " sinful " by the church .
GUPT
That conduct , homosexuality .
The Wileys say most black churches are very conservative and traditional .
And because most consider homosexuality a sin , many pastors do n't want to address it .
This issue , for whatever reason , is so volatile .
And it tends to bring out such bitterness and venom .
They 're a perpetrator of , you know , of the stigma by both not addressing it and by both -- and also addressing it in ways that are not helpful but harmful .
In fact , infection rates are much higher for African- Americans than any other group .
Blacks make up only 13 percent of the population , but account for half of all new infections .
AIDS is increasingly becoming a black disease in the United States .
According to the Centers for Disease Control , it 's the leading cause of death for African-Americans , especially for women age 25 to 34.
Black children are diagnosed four times as much as white or Hispanic children .
Still , the place one would often turn for spiritual sustenance and healing has problems providing that for some .
It 's affecting our entire community .
So we cannot afford to have our heads in the sand .
People are suffering .
People are dying .
People need help .
And I believe that that 's -- Jesus Christ would respond to that need , but I think the black church in some ways has gotten off track .
The Wileys say churches will not have any impact on HIV in the black community until they come together collectively to address the disease .
And it 's up to pastors to lead the way .
Blacks , more than any other ethnic group , are being disproportionately affected .
HIV seems to affect every segment of this population .
And the stigma associated with the disease only adds to the problem .
Let 's head back to the studio now with Judy Fortin and this week 's medical headlines .
Thanks , Sanjay .
We start with news about a popular cosmetic treatment .
Research finds the wrinkle filler Restylane increases the amount of collagen the skin produces .
Collagen naturally restores the skin 's elasticity .

The digital age may be fattening for America 's teens .
A new study shows between middle school and high school , students spend on average four hours more per week on the computer , while vigorous physical activity declined , a major concern since reduced physical activity is linked to increases obesity .
And Sanjay , you may want to take a lesson from those teens .
New research finds that surgeons who play video games have better motor skills .
Study authors say surgeons who game for more than three hours per week make fewer errors , work faster , and perform 42 percent better .
So Sanjay , in your spare time , maybe video games are a good option .
Back to you .
Video games , huh ?
I actually play them all the time .
Thanks , Judy , for that report .
