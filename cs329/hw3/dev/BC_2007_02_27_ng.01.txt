Right , but you can come in from out of state , from out of county , and do that , unless they have some rule I do n` t know about there .
But I`ll tell you what .
This Judge Seidlin , in my opinion -- I call him Judge Fonzie -- he made the right decision in this case , and I think it` s ...
Correction , Michael .
Fonzie was cool .
You want to hear my childlife ?
You want to hear all the things she did to me ?
You want to hear all the things she let my father do to me , or my brother do to me , or my sister , the beatings , the whippings , the rape ?
That` s my mother .
That` s my mom .
What do you want to say to her ?
I want to say to her , how dare you , ( bleep) .
How dare you .
That` s what I want to say .
Come after me .
Come on , get yours .
You know what ?
I used to cry after you .
I used to cry after you , from the day , even when I am a baby girl , I cried for you .
And you asked Howard , I cried for my mom .
I cry for my mom when I saw her on CNN, and I saw how evil she was and evil she looked .
So bring it on , mama , mommy dearest .
That was an interview that was shown in court last week , an interview that Anna Nicole Smith gave to " E.T. , " " Entertainment Tonight , " back in October .
In it , Anna Nicole Smith describes the estrangement between herself and her mom .
Of course , her mom has a very different perception of their relationship , distant , but loving relationship , according to Virgie Arthur .
Let` s go out to the lines .
Carol in Florida , hi , Carol .
Hi , Nancy .
What` s your question , dear ?
On the off chance that Virgie does win tomorrow , and she wants to move Daniel , as well , to Texas , would she then have to go back to court again to win the right to move Daniel` s body , as well ?
Joe Lawless , out to you .
It` s my understanding that absolutely you have to have a court order in order to exhume and move a body .
Well , she` d have to have a court order to do it , but Daniel` s buried in the Bahamas .
The Florida courts would have no jurisdiction over any such request .
Right , she would have to get the order in the Bahamas .
Right , so that` s highly unlikely that` s going to happen .
And luckily she` s in the Bahamas .
To you , Jean Casarez , what is the story behind an alleged alliance between Stern and Birkhead , mortal enemies in the courtroom ?
Right , a settlement talk is what is being said .
Well , we heard the rumors , and then now we`ve seen Larry Birkhead give interviews , as of this morning .
And the reports have said that there are settlement talks .
Well , if there are , you know it involves paternity testing , you know it` s going to be very , very specific , like , " You are called Uncle Howard , " as time goes on .
And I` m sure money enters into all those agreements .
