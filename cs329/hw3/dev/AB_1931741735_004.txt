" The Small Business Millionaire " is about a mysterious patron of a failing restaurant who aids the owners in restoring their business .
The cook/owner of the restaurant , Frank , just wants to cook .
He really does not want to run the business .
His daughter Jennifer was just a college student who worked in the restaurant .
She then , inspired by the annoyingly mysterious coach , Jonathan , quits college and starts managing the restaurant .
She sees it as means to saving the restaurant and increasing her practical business knowledge .
This brazen move worries her father .
Is Jennifer making a foolish decision ?
There are only 121 pages in " The Small Business Millionaire . "
I thought it would be concise and to the point .
This is not the case .
When I began to read " The Small Business Millionaire , " I was surprised to see that it was a novel , not a textbook-like guide to getting rich quickly .
I read through the first half of the book , hoping that the degrading preaching would end , and the exciting novel would begin .
No such luck .
I felt hostage in one of those get-rich-quick seminars .
It was as if the doors were locked or the television could not be turned off .
The coach in the book would not answer a question in a straight-forward manner .
Everything had to be in riddle form .
I am sure that there were many great lessons to learn from " The Small Business Millionaire , " but I could not get past the fact that the book was written for the lowest common denominator .
Why insult your readers by dumbing down the material ?
Regardless of how poorly written , " The Small Business Millionaire , " Chandler and Beckford are superb coaches .
To learn from Steve Chandler and Sam Beckford , skip reading " The Small Business Millionaire . "
Read " 9 Lies that are Holding Your Business Back . "
You will learn so much more .
