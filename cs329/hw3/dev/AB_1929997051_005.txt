I have just started to use the workbook , which is supposed to be used in 30 day program .
Very interested questions are put to the reader to make him/her think about elements which might be the reason for TMS or TMS like disorders ( alergy ... ) .
But what to do with answers ?
Can I analise them by myself ?
I am afraid , that something is missing here .
One might expect , that in a last chapter a roadmap of disorders could be found , or maybe results of analises of answers to the same questions made by experts , that I could just put my self-diagnosis into certain group .
Nevertheless I read dr .
Sarno 's book on TMS , I am still an amateur , not able to identify my problems .
Or maybe I should write this review after 3 weeks ...
