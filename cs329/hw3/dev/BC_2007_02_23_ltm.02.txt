Let 's turn to your home now .
CNN 's Gerri Willis is just north of New York City , in Hartsdale , New York .
Hey , Gerri .
Good morning .
GERRI Willis , CNN PERSONAL FINANCE EDITO
Hey .
Good morning , Soledad .
You know , I 'm in a kitchen here that has been recently remodeled .
Now , if you are hiring a contractor , the devil is in the details .
First off , make sure you ask for a license .
You can check them out at the attorney general 's Web site for your state .
That 's where they have to file all that stuff .
And then you want to make sure you ask for references of any contractor -- general contractors , a subcontractor .
You want some references .
Make sure that they are not buddies of the contractor .
Check out the work , too , of the subcontractors , because it is just as important that the guy doing your floor is as good as the general contractor .
Also , we mentioned this before .
Do n't pay all at once .
You want to put down 10 to 25 percent at the first go , and then slowly pay over time as the major systems of your reno get done , whether that 's electrical or plumbing .
Each step , give them a little bit of money along the way , and then hold back a little at the end .
It is called retainage ( ph ) .
This will give you some power over your contractor if that final punch list is n't finished the way you want it finished .
Finally , if you do have a problem , you can take them to court .
You do n't have to hire an attorney to get help .
You can go to small claims court .
It costs $ 30.
You 'll present your case yourself in front of the judge , and then you will have some kind of resolution .
Now , if you are not getting money back from your contractor that you want , go to that licensing board .
They will help nail down that payment from your contractor .
But again , it 's only $ 30.
Easy enough to do .
Cheap enough to do .
We 're going to have more on this topic Saturday morning , 9:30 a.m. , on " OPEN HOUSE. "
" Ripped Off . " Join us then .
All right .
We sure will .
Gerri , thank you .
