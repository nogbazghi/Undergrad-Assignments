-- and my Dad currently still resides in Kuwait even as we speak .
So
Your English is very good .
thank you .
There 's --
Well , my -- my parents are Nigerian actually .
Uh-huh .
Um --
Oh , well --
So Ibo was my first language --
Well , your -- your -- your -- your -- your --
-- and then English my second .
-- your English accent is , uh , remarkably American .
It i- -- it is .
It 's --
You 've done quite well in that regard --
-- and you 're probably throwing the linguistics study off -- off the --
I know , I 'm sure I am .
That 's not our problem though .
Yeah , so , um , it 's even more so a personal thing to me .
Mhm .
I did n't understand it the first time , I still do n't understand it this time as to --
Mhm .
-- you know , why this is going on .
It 's --
-- it 's just crazy , I mean , millions -- not millions , but so many people are -- so many civilians are getting hurt over there .
So , I mean , when you turn on the news , you constantly see , you know , innocent children , mothers , men , families being torn apart , being hurt , being wounded over , as you said , Bush being a child , being a boy --
Yeah .
-- playing with these toys , you know --
Well , it 's a --
-- trying to avenge --
Right .
-- whatever between his father and Saddam .
Right , so , um , you know , a lot -- a lot of this , uh , you know , this game , h - h - having -- having had US military in the family for all generations prior --
Mhm .
-- to mine , uh , I -- I do think I understand a little bit about the -- the military outlook on the things as well , and , uh , to some extent a lot of the stuff that we see media wise is so orchestrated .
Yeah , that 's true .
Um , and , you know , a - a - and all parties are orchestrating , uh , you know , and both sides are providing propaganda in the extreme .
Um , I do have my doubts as to the extreme level of civilian casualties , uh , primarily because an awful lot of regular forces on the , uh -- on the opposing side , uh , quickly doffed their uniforms , uh , you know , they 're not following the , oh , the accepted procedures .
Mm .
Uh , such that an awful lot of the civilian personnel that are crying in the hospitals are not necessarily civilian personnel , certainly the adult males , the vast majority are not civilians .
Mm .
Uh , the -- the others , that 's , in a lot of respects , that 's because of the -- one , th - the methods that are used by the opposition , uh , you know , the , uh , if you look back at some of the , uh , some of the coverage that was provided of -- of the prior , uh , conflict with , uh , um , European citizens who did not get out soon enough --
