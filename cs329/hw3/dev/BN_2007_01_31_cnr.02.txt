But , in a place where religion so often sparks violence , it was religion alone that ruled the day .
Michael Holmes joins us from Baghdad .
Michael , as always , great to see you .
A couple of questions .
Let 's play a little what if game here .
What if you walk down that same street with your crew in say a week from now without that sheikh there or any U.S. troops ?
Probably a different result , I think it 's fair to say , Tony .
It 's important to understand that there are varying -- this is an area that is largely under the control of the Mehdi militia , Muqtada al-Sadr 's group .
But there are shades of gray with the Mehdi militia .
In Sadr City , very hard line .
In Kadamia , not so much .
They are hard lined , but not as hard lined as the others .
So -- but I still think that without the sheikh there , we would n't have got very far down that street without , at the very least , being told to leave .
It also highlights the importance of tribal power in this country , which it 's been said for a long time the U.S. has n't fully understand , that sheikh rules in that area .
Tony .
Hey , Michael , you mentioned to the colonel in your story that things were different a couple of mile away , across the river .
Explain that one for us .
Well , it was interesting .
I raised that because just two days -- the day before , in fact , for two days we had been in an area called Amamia ( ph ) , which is a Sunni stronghold , probably the most dangerous suburb in all of Baghdad , hanging out with Charlie Company at a place called Father Patchy , which is literally a house in the middle of the suburb .
The soldiers call it the Alamo .
They have daily attacks there .
Grenade attacks .
Rocket launch ( ph ) .
So and that 's literally just across the river .
And if you walked over there , you would last about five minutes .
So a great difference by comparison just crossing the river .
It was amazing .
Brother .
Michael Holmes for us in Baghdad .
Michael , great to see you .
Thank you .
Tens of millions of your tax dollars wasted . That 's according to a quarterly audit of Iraq reconstruction aid .
It 's being released today .
Some examples from the report now .
$ 43 million spent on a residential camp for police training .
It has stood empty for months .
About $ 4 million of that money said to be improperly spent on VIP trailers and an Olympic-size swimming pool .
According to the report , those were ordered but Iraqi officials but never authorized by the U.S.
And the report says more than $ 36 million was spent for weapons , like armored vehicles and body armor that cannot be accounted for .
And still to come , a warning about global warming .
It 's as if we 're standing in a swimming pool with the water up to our chest .
When the temperature rises , now the water is up to our chin or our nose and every little wave is going to mean that it 's over our heads .
