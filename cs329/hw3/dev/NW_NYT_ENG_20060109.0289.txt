HURRICANE EVACUEES IN HOTELS CAN GET AN EXTENSION ; FEMA SAYS AN
AUTHORIZATION CODE WILL LET THEM STAY UNTIL FEB. 13 , POSSIBLY
BEYOND HOUSTON -- Federal officials said Monday that evacuees who
fled hurricanes Katrina and Rita and are living in hotel
rooms must obtain permission from the Federal Emergency Management Agency
to remain there beyond Feb. 7.
By obtaining an authorization code , evacuees can remain in their rooms
through at least Feb. 13 , and possibly longer , said R.
David Paulison , the acting director of FEMA.
Evacuees occupy 10,848 hotel rooms in Texas , according to federal officials .
More than half of those rooms -- about 5,800 --
are in the greater Houston area .
" This authorization code process will help us work toward ensuring that
no one eligible for assistance slips through the cracks , " Paulison
said Monday .
Evacuees must seek an authorization code by Jan . 30 .
New hotel check-ins no longer will be allowed without a code .
Last year , FEMA originally sought to end hotel assistance Dec. 1 ,
a deadline that provoked considerable public and political outcry .
Following
a lawsuit against the agency , U.S. District Court Judge Stanwood
Duval ordered the agency to allow evacuees to remain in
hotels until Feb. 7.
FEMA officials said Monday the new "authorization code " policy complies with
Duval 's order .
His court is expected to review FEMA 's work
later this week .
Paulison said the new policy is part of the agency 's plan
to transition evacuees eligible for housing assistance -- those who
lost homes and apartments because of the storms -- from
shelters and hotels into longer-term housing .
Evacuees must apply to FEMA to receive long-term housing assistance , such
as money for apartment rent .
As there have been some
delays in processing requests for this assistance , FEMA will continue
to pay applicants ' hotel costs for two weeks after a
determination has been made .
The long-term housing matter is complicated in Houston , which created its
own housing program in Katrina 's wake .
Under the program , which
has housed more than 100,000 evacuees , Houston pays rent and
some utilities for 12 months , and then is reimbursed by
FEMA.
But the federal agency has sought to stop reimbursing Houston for
its payments March 1 , raising the possibility that thousands of
evacuees could be evicted from their apartments .
FEMA has said those evacuees housed by Houston 's plan simply need
to apply for long-term housing from the agency , and pay
the rent costs on their own .
But some local activists
have said the process is too cumbersome , and complain that
the March 1 deadline would be disastrous for the largest
evacuee community in the country .
Mayor Bill White also has accused FEMA of breaking a promise
to the city to support its 12-month program .
White still expects to reach a compromise on the March 1
deadline , spokesman Frank Michel said Monday .
Negotiations will continue this
week .
Yet time is running short .
If Houston is to avoid incurring
financial losses , it must notify the apartments it will void
the leases by the end of this month .
