-- you know , is the other question .
But I guess with your background again you probably can consider a lot of points that I ca n't .
Um , you said you 've been enlisted for over twenty two years now ?
Yeah , well , national gar- -- between the national guard and -- and regular army .
Mhm .
You know , I travelled quite extensively all over the world and things like this , but , uh , you know , I was n't -- everybody -- it seems like everyone you talk to now was , y- -- was , you know , Sergeant York and -- and were fighting and stuff like this .
I -- I never liked firing my gun --
Mhm .
-- you know , and I -- I probably was , if anything , an average soldier --
Ahah .
-- not -- not any more , not any less .
I was more on the technical side of things .
I did n't like the whole running around in the woods and -- and firing guns and things like that , weapons .
I mean I guess you probably have people on both ends , but what 's your training like when you go through something like that ?
I mean , um , with this project it sounds like they tried to be very , very humanitarian .
Do you think that that 's how they are just in general or do you think that that 's something they are trying to -- to portray more heavily on the news as , you know , the image of the US troops just because the rest of the world was sort of against US involvement ?
Well , I -- I think Americans -- and , you know , I 've looked at it from World War Two and -- and , you know , I was stationed over in Germany and I -- and I was , um , worked with a couple of guys who were there in Frankfurt when we bombed ninety seven per cent of Frankfurt into dust and he- he said , " You know , the -- we were afraid of the Americans .
One day you 're fighting us and the next day you 're feeding us " --
Yeah .
-- so it 's -- it 's a very -- Americans have always been that way , um , you know , I -- I do n't think as a people we hold grudges like other people .
That 's why I think we look at the Middle East and we see , um , we see some of these conflicts that go on for centuries .
Yeah , but they 're religious conflicts basically .
They 're religious conflicts .
And I think in the US with our separation of church and state , I mean everybody has the freedom to do what they want and religion is supposed to be set aside when it comes to government affairs --
Yeah .
I [inaudible ] --
-- and over there it 's -- it 's not like that .
But they look at u- -- they look at this as a religious where they look at it as Islam versus Christian --
