I really enjoy the book . I 'm a Nine year old girl and I will be visiting WAshington D. C. with my family this summer .
I thought the book was very interesting because it told me everything you can see in the city .
It has really good pictures of things you can find .
It has great maps , pockets for stamps and envelopes , and other lose items .It had very good background information .
It has made me excited about my trip .
