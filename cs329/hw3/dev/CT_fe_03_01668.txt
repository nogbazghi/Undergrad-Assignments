But , I mean , it 's a shame .
It 's horrible when , you know , cultural things like that are -- are lost .
Yeah [inaudible] .
But freedom is far more important and -- and getting someone as evil as Saddam out --
Mhm .
-- so that people can be protected , I think is far more important .
Yes , me too .
Um --
Well , we 're about half way there .
Has it been five minutes ?
I have n't been looking at the clock .
Um , this is random but it 's about the war .
Um , a friend of mine was telling me a story that he read in the newspaper or something .
This is several weeks ago .
Mhm .
Um , he said that there was some US troops who they -- I think they were -- it was when they were trying to get to Baghdad , I think .
Mhm .
And they had to go through this other town or something on the way .
And , um , when they went through this town there was -- all the citizens , like , kind of started to , um , protest against them 'cause they thought they were there to --
Mhm .
-- hurt them .
But they really were n't , they were just passing through .
Um , and so one of the commanders or General , I do n't know , one of the leaders of the troops that were there told all his men -- like , the , um , protestors or the citizens were kind of in a big group and they were , like , advancing at the troops .
Um , so the , um , General told all the men to take a knee , so they all got down and , like , the citizens kind of stopped .
And then , um , he told them to put their guns down and smile and so all the US guys were , like , sitting on the ground smiling and then they realized that they were n't there to hurt 'em and --
Mm .
-- they started smiling back and they were just like , " Okay , it 's all okay" .
I thought that was a neat story .
Ah , yeah , that 's pretty weird .
Um --
That instead of saying , you know , " Oh , they 're just taking up arms against us let 's shoot them " .
Right .
' Cause , I mean , they -- they could n't communicate so I --
Yeah .
-- thought it was just neat that by doing that they were able to let them know that , " Hey , we 're not here to hurt you , we 're trying to help you " .
So ...
Back when that was all happening , you know , before they had captured Baghdad of course .
Mhm .
Um , I had heard on the news too just how the citizens were being threatened .
That --
Mhm .
I do n't know who , but they were going to the homes --
Mhm .
-- saying , you know , " Your sons are going to come and fight and if you do n't we 're gonna shoot you and .. . " I mean , I just thought , " How horrible , how scary " .
