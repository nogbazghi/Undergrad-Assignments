TALLAHASSEE - When the Florida Legislature passes a law , the public
is usually left to sort out what it means and
to live with the consequences .
Not this time .
Now , the people who write the laws are scratching their heads
over how they altered their own lives when they banned
lobbyists and their clients from making "any expenditure " to lawmakers .
It turns out that a bold statement of ethical clarity ,
passed in the rush of a four-day special session last
month , is a lot more complicated .
That 's because the public lives of legislators and lobbyists are so
closely intertwined .
Some legislators get rent-free offices from cities and counties that employ
lobbyists .
They park free in county-owned airports that hire lobbyists .
When they go to a state agency to tour its
operations , they get a free lunch from the agency , which
has a lobbyist on its payroll .
All three situations would appear to be taboo under a new
blanket ban on gifts from lobbyists , but House and Senate
lawyers are working on rules that lawmakers can use to
guide them through the thicket of daily interactions that can
involve the mundane , and now illegal , exchange of food and
drink .
The rules are sure to add layers of nuance to a
gift ban that Sen. Jim Sebesta , R-St .
Petersburg , defined simply
as " Dutch treat or do n't eat . "
The House 's 120 members will gather today for a gift-ban training
session , while lawyers for the House and Senate labor over
a list of dos and do n'ts and formal rules that
are meant to guide future political behavior .
Rep.
Dudley Goodlette , a Naples Republican and one of the authors
of the gift ban , said his first objective is to
advise members what the "letter and spirit " of the law
is , and to strictly adhere to it .
" My other goal is to not throw common sense totally out
the window , " Goodlette said .
Goodlette , who pays $ 1 a year for legislative office space in
a Collier County government building , said that perk is for
the convenience of the public and is a gift to
" the institution of the House , " not to him .
Goodlette , a lawyer , also said a state agency 's offer of a
lunch and transportation as part of a tour is part
of a legislator 's official state business .
" I think we want members to be educated , " Goodlette said .
" I
do n't think we had any intention in this undertaking ...
for this to adversely affect or impact the members ' ability
to learn as much as they can about the public
policy issues we 're called upon to address . "
The state ethics law includes an exemption from the definition of
a gift for the use of public property that has
a "public benefit , " an exemption lawyers for the Legislature are
considering adding to the gift-ban rules .
But some longtime lobbyists strongly challenged Goodlette 's interpretation .
" That 's nice , but how do you do that when the law
does n't allow you to do that ? " said lobbyist Ken Plante .
Plante , a former senator , is a member of the Florida Association
of Professional Lobbyists , a group pondering legal action to block
the new law if it can raise enough money to
cover legal fees .
FAPL members are not protesting the gift
ban - rather , they dislike a provision in the law
requiring them for the first time to disclose their income .
" I see it as nothing but an invasion of my privacy ,
and it has no bearing on the process , " Plante said .
Now that lobbyists are forbidden from wining and dining legislators , he
argued , how much a lobbyist earns is irrelevant .
" What difference
does it make ? "
Plante asked .
Florida became the fourth state to enact a ban on gifts
from lobbyists to legislators , joining Massachusetts , North Carolina and Wisconsin ,
according to the National Conference of State Legislatures .
Since legislators passed the law Dec. 8 , dozens of them have
peppered lawyers with questions about how the ban affects everything
from birthday cards from lobbyists to Chamber of Commerce dinners .
" If I have had a longtime personal relationship with a friend
who is employed by a municipality with a lobbyist , may
I accept a dinner invitation either to his or her
home or a restaurant if they are paying the bill ? "
asked Sen. Evelyn Lynn , R-Ormond Beach , in an e-mail to
Senate counsel Steve Kahn .
No legislator wants to be the first to get trapped in
a gift-ban violation , especially in an election year .
Some lawmakers
are frustrated that the answers to their questions are slow
in coming .
" There 's a lot of frustration from members and the lobby corps .
They do n't know where to go for answers , " said Rep.
Loranne Ausley , D-Tallahassee , a member of a team of House
members seeking to clarify the many questions .
Gov.
Jeb Bush said he hopes the House and Senate can
agree on the dos and do n'ts , because the gift ban
also affects executive branch employees who work for the governor .
" We want to make sure that we 're all on the same
page about the rules that are established to meet the
intent of the law , " he said .
" I do n't know if
there 's a convergence of agreement with the House and the
Senate .
... If we could all get on the same
page , it would be better , because it is complicated .
There 's
no question about it . "
