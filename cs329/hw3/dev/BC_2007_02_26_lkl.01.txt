And welcome back to LARRY KING LIVE.
One program reminder .
The speaker of the House of Representatives , Nancy Pelosi , our special guest tomorrow night .
An extraordinary event is going to take place on the Discovery Channel this Sunday night , March 4th .
They will premier the last -- or , rather , " The Lost Tomb of Jesus . "
There is a companion book accompanying it , " The Jesus Family Tomb , " being published by Harper San Francisco .
We welcome to LARRY KING LIVE from New York , James Cameron , the Oscar winning filmmaker .
Good to see him again .
He is the executive producer of " The Lost Tomb of Jesus . "
And Simcha Jacobovici .
He is the Emmy Award winning documentarian , the director , producer and writer of " The Lost Tomb of Jesus . "
And we 'll have some comments from Ben Wedeman , our CNN senior correspondent in Jerusalem .
And there you see Ben in front of what might be the tomb .
Jim , give me a little history here .
What 's this all about ?
JAMES CAMERON , EXECUTIVE PRODUCER , " THE LOST TOMB OF JESUS" : Well , Simcha came to me about two years ago with this project and asked if I wanted to be involved .
And at first I was kind of skeptical and I asked to see the evidence .
I said what have you got , because it was just -- there was too much of a wow factor .
It was just -- it was just too unfathomable .
And as I got into it and I really studied what he had , what Simcha had basically done was he had connected the dots between two unconnected things .
You had experts , on the one hand , who had understood that there were certain names in 1st or 2nd century Christian texts .
And then , on the other hand , you had archaeologists who had found this tomb in 1980 , in Jerusalem .
And in that tomb they found -- they found ossuaries with some very provocative names .
There was Jesus , son of Joseph .
There were two Marys .
There was another Joseph , a diminutive name , " Yosef . "
And there was a Matthew and there was a Judah .
And it turns out that -- that when Simcha was able to connect all the dots , it started to look like a compelling case for this being the tomb of Jesus .
Simcha , what took from 1980 to 2007 for this to come about as a documentary ?
SIMCHA JACOBOVICI , DIRECTOR , " THE LOST TOMB OF JESUS" : Well , I was n't involved in 1980 .
In 1980 , the archaeologists found the tomb .
It was archaeologists .
It was n't found by some amateurs or something like that .
They found this cluster of names .
But they dismissed the cluster because they said statistically it 's not significant .
There were a lot of people named Judas , Mary .
And so , Jesus , Judah , Mary , and so on , it 's not significant .
It 's common names .
The other thing is , the second Mary in the tomb was n't Mary Magdalene , you know ?
And her name was a variant of Miriam , a Greek variant , Mariamene .
So there 's two Marys in the tomb , one named Maria , which is -- comes down to , in the Christian tradition , the mother of Jesus ; but the other one , Mariamene .
