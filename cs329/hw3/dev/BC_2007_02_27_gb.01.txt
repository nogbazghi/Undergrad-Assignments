No, pictures of the baby to the photos that we had of the five potential fathers as well as Anna , of course .
OK .
And so then you took that -- you took that information and then you aged the baby to make her look like this picture ?
That` s correct .
OK .
And you actually take some of the characteristics of the father , and you -- you mix them into this photo , and that` s -- that` s how you got them .
You mixed the photos of the two .
We put it all in the pot , and we just stir it up , and we -- this is what we came up with .
BECK ; I`ve heard that people have actually -- tell me if this is true or not .
I`ve heard people who are like 80 years old will send a 30-year- old picture of themselves and say , " Hey , what am I going to look like when I` m 80 ? " Is that true ?
That` s true .
We do it for a lot of weddings .
The husband wants to see what his wife will look like just to make sure he , you know .
Wow .
No, but I`ve heard that older people send it in and then compare , and it` s pretty accurate .
We`ve had some customers who have kind of , I guess , tested us , you can say .
Go ahead .
Go ahead ?
Well , just photos of themselves when they were younger to see what they would look like now , and we were very accurate .
Can any of this be used in a paternity hearing ?
If they want to use it , I mean , I do n` t know why they just do n` t use the DNA .
They can use it .
We` d love for them to use it .
Yes .
OK .
Emy , thanks a lot .
Coming up next , why NAFTA` s superhighway is bad for business , bad for our security and bad for the environment , Al Gore .
That` s tonight` s " Real Story" , next .
All right , welcome to " The Real Story . "
Yesterday , I told you about James Cameron and how he does n` t believe in miracles , especially the religious ones .
Well , yesterday , Jim better steer clear of Houston , Texas , now that Miss Guadalupe Rodriguez is in town , because the Virgin Mary appeared to her on a pizza pan .
Now , I` m not saying that the holy mother definitely appeared on a giant cookie sheet , but I` m not not saying that either .
So , James Cameron , who feels stupid now ?
Moving on , you know that fence that the government is supposed to be building between the United States and Mexico ?
Personally , I do n` t think that thing is ever going to be built for all kinds of reasons , most of them revolving around politicians in Washington who have sold us out , like a bunch of jellyfish .
Today , some Democrats and environmental groups are now doing their extra-special part to make sure that I` m right .
Their latest problem with a fence along the border is that they feel it will interfere with the native habitat of the ocelot , a blood-thirsty mountain cat .
The real story is : Boo frickin` hoo!
