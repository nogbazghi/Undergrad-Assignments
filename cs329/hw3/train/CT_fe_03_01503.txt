-- of the news casts about nine eleven it did make me more and more depressed but it was -- it was a shock , it was such a shock thing I could n't not turn the TV off and I could n't stand to watch it .
Yeah I was , um , the day of September eleventh my daughter was born on August twenty fourth so she was n't even a month old and I was sitting in the living room and -- at my aunt 's house and that 's , you know , when my -- my cousin pointed it out to me , I was like , " No , no , whatever , you know , you 're just , you know , exaggerating " because , you know , he was making a big deal out of it and then I was watching -- started watching it and I was like , " Oh , my God , you know , it was like , what did I do , I brought my daughter into this word and now we 're --" because in my mind I though we were going to go to war for sure , you know , that day .
So , I was just , you know , I was terrified but , um , it -- it eased off because , you know , it 's -- it 's -- I -- I feel that , um , my -- my country is protecting me and I have faith in it , so .
Well , I really appreciate the fact that our leadership has --
-- has been as adamant about saying we 're just are n't going to allow this sort of thing .
Yeah .
And even though they have not , um , found for sure that Bin Laden 's out of the picture --
-- um , they , you know , put the quahedis[ ? ]
on his ability to continue and do more , but , ah , the cells of people who are the offshoots of -- and little individual cells of terrorists are crazy .
Yeah .
And they are --
-- still existing and I was not really aware that it was --
-- as easy for them to exist in this country as it seems to have been and I just really applaud everyone whose perking up their ears and providing information for fire departments and police departments an- and information for people , it 's just -- it 's just really sad that my granddaughter who 's now in the third grade is learning wh - you know , what in school there needs to be doing if there 's -- they see any white powder anywhere --
-- or , you know
And , um , -- and I remember as a child --
It was during , ah , right after world war two we had nuclear bomb drills where at school we were drilling and -- and rehearsing to get --
-- under the desk to hide from a nuclear attack .
Oh , goodness .
I , um , after the September eleventh , I will just give you an idea how scared I was .
Um , I got some mail and I opened a letter and , you know , I do n't know what it was , it was n't anthrax obviously because I 'm here today
