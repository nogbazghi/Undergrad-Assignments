My thumb and index fingers left small crinkles and tear marks on several pages because of the odd sensation of actively participating in the story -- gripping the page tighter when reading intense , pulse-quickening , gut-wrenching passages .
I often felt as if my heart sank into the pit of my stomach .
There were moments when I felt frustrated that I could n't will my eyes and brain to read and register faster , but I also found myself savoring the prose and imagery despite wanting desperately to know what would happen next in the story .
I very much appreciate the insight and perspective that I 've been able to gain from this novel -- of Afghan culture , history , etc .
But more so because it was through the voices of two women who give a name and face to those countless nameless/faceless beings that have endured similar experiences .
Most of all , I appreciate the acknowledgment of three universal themes : faith , hope , and love .
