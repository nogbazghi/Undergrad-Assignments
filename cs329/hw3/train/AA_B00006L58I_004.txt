and have been more than happy with it .
It is , I think , the low end of the Kitchenaid mixers , much like the classic .
But I also think , from all the reviews I have read that this one will out do and out last the pricier and admittedly prettier Artisian series .
I am not an uber baker , so I cannot say how long this would last if I baked everyday .
With a little care I think a long time .
The directions are very clear about what speeds to use and what amount of specific flours that should be used to ensure that the motor can handle the work .
I do make more bread now than I used to , the ease of letting the mixer knead for 10 minutes while I am free to do other things in the kitchen is wonderful .
Also for those big holiday meals this takes the work out of everything from baking to mashing potatos .
Highly recomended .
