We received one of these as a wedding present back in June of 2004 .
It ran great as of yesterday when the drive gear broke .
I called Cuisinart and because I did not have a receipt , I received no help at all .
No replacement , no service , and a very rude customer service agent .
Luckily Bed Bath and Beyond took the mixer back and provided a replacement of our choosing .
We did NOT pick a Cuisinart .
