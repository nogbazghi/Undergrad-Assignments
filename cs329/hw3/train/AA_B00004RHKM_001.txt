Good wet or dry vac.
I bought it so I could plug a power tool into it and hook it up to the dust port .
I do n't know what kind of tool you can use with it but when I tried to use it with my miter saw or belt sander it just blows the safty breaker .
As a vac it 's OK but since the dust port switch does n't work , I could have gotten more power and larger diameter hose for less money .
