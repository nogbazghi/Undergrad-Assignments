So , you know -- and it just -- I guess I just do n't think about it .
Mhm .
Yeah , me too .
And it 's -- mm , that 's kinda sad to think , " Jeeze something so horrendous happened and here we already are , you know .. . " But I guess that 's human nature to --
Yeah .
You do n't wanna dwel- dwell on it .
Yeah .
If it 's just gonna -- it 's not going to make you happy or ...
Yeah .
So --
Mm It -- they should have topics like cookies .
Oh yeah , I could talk about that .
Yeah , for hours at a time .
Mm .
So , where you 're from it 's not -- I mean it 's just a little suburb ?
It 's more rural .
There 's actually like , two miles away there 's dairy farms that have cows --
Oh , wow .
Oh , wow .
-- and things like that so it 's really rural .
Okay .
It 's not just , you know , small town it 's small town rural .
But there is a , um , branch of the state university system --
Oh , okay .
-- here in the town so that 's -- I guess that 's why they put it here is to , you know , that 's the only kind of , you know , economic help it could give , you know , a hundred ago was to found one of the colleges here .
Oh , okay .
And ther- there are a lot of international people but we -- you know , it 's not like they 're holding all our mail hostage to see if it 's --
Do you think , um , because of where you live it would n't be , you know , it would n't --

Yeah , I think so because it 's -- the wh - -- it 's like out there is the whole rest of the world .
Mhm .
Even , you know , to just hop in the car and go the half an hour to Pittsburgh , it 's just --
Yeah .
-- that 's , you know , it 's like a trip .
Yeah .
Maybe a road trip .
Uh-huh .
I think because , you know , because I live in a city and it 's , you know , well known it 's just kind of -- it 's kind of scary sometimes you never know 'cause , you know , everybody knows where San Francisco is , you know .
Yeah , that 's true .
So --
And that it 's actually -- it a tourist place , you know --
Yeah .
-- that all kinds of new and different people are there all the time .
Yeah .
In my town , we know if there 's somebody new or different .
With all the college students you just -- everybody kind of gets used to seeing each other .
Uh-huh , yeah .
That 's kinda nice .
That 's -- it 's a , as they say , " A fine place to raise a small child " but then when they get to be teenagers they 're always on the road to Pittsburgh --
