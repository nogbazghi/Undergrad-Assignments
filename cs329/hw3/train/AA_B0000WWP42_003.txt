I saw this humidifier in Wal-Mart ; however , the box did not offer enough information .
Therefore , I researched it on-line .
I liked the filterless system .
Many years ago , I purchased a Duracraft humidifier but donated it a couple years later due to the expense of the filter .
While I read the numerous reviews , I decided to try this product out of desperation .
Pros : This humidifier separates easily for cleaning and refilling .
However , when I went to refill the container , the gasket came loose , but the container did not leak .
Cons : This humidifier noise level kept me awake at night .
Also , when the water level drops down , this humidifier gurgles on the medium and high level .
After two days , I returned this humidifier .
I am looking at Vicks Cool Mist Humidifier V4500 , which claims to be 27 % quieter and more expensive .
