I bought this vacuum based on the reviews it received and I was very disappointed .
For a dustbuster it is very loud .
Much louder than what I was looking for .
As loud as a full on heavy duty vacuum .
Considering it does not pick up much on the carpet or the floor , I ca n't imagine why it has to make so much noise .
I returned it after one use .
The filter was completely clogged with dust after the one use and will need to be cleaned after each use .
Do n't waste your money on this one .
If you are looking for a lightweight vacuum for the floor and short carpets consider the Swivel Sweeper touchless .
It works great picking up dust , sand , dirt , food off our hardwood floors and does a light cleaning on our wool rug.
It is not perfect , but it works just as well as sweeping yourself .
