I 've found the 30-minute body relaxation exercise to be a great stress relief on my way to work or when lying in bed .
Having listened to the CD regularly for the past few weeks , I am finding that it is making a profound difference in my ability to relax .
I am so happy to discover that the "relaxation response " , the brain 's response to quiet meditation , is real , and actually reverses the effects of stress .
It 's making a bigger difference than I would have imagined .
Having experienced increasing stress over the past year , I am so grateful and relieved to find something that helps .
Many thanks to the author for her peaceful voice and healing images .
