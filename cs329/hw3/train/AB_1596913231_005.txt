Far from revealing any " secrets " , this book reads like a minimally organized pastiche of historical snippets commonly acccessible to any grade school student researching Paris .
The entire text is compsed in jejune paragraphs as if the author himself could n't even stay interested enough to sustain any intellectual progression of thought .
If there is anything postive to be said about this deceptively titled book it is that its inadequacies can serve to encourage interested readers to pursue further information in other books or resources .
" Ah , Paris ...your 'secrets " are still out there waiting to be discovered and savored ! "
