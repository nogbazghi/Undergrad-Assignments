Why I had this on the shelf for a year I do n't know .
Well , not true -- I do know .
I was afraid as some other reviewers have said , that it would be heavy and depressing .
But it is not at all .
It is a wonderful narrative and description of France in wartime -- in real time .
Others have said so much -- if you have read this far , take a chance -- you wo n't be disappointed !
