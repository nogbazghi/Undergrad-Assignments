I 'm in a upper-level undergrad college course and have two other "academic " books to read as well .
I ca n't help it - they both have great critical reviews and all that , but they are dry to the bone .
This book has actually helped give me an overview of why things happened because I read it before I dive "into the weeds " .
After I read the assigned chapters in my two college history books , I come out with a better understanding with the Idiot 's guide than had I read the books without the Idiot 's guide .
Plus , I have used this Idiot 's guide to answer some of my many essay questions .
The only flaw that I have noticed is that once it hits upon the overview , it does n't give you any more in depth facts and then I plunge into 30 mins or more of actual college research .
If my college texts was as interesting as this one , I would actually like to take my mandatory History course ( sorry to all you History lovers who might be reading my review ) .
I give this book my recommendation for a good , quick overview read of WW2 and I strongly recommend to other college students out there to read this book before you take a WW2 course .
