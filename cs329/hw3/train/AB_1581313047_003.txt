If you absolutely have no idea what "finance " is , you might want to check out this book at your local friendly public library .
Otherwise , check out other finance career guides .
This book is a waste of time and much of the stuff is either inaccurate or not useful at all .
I know because I sit on the other side of the table at finance interviews : I 'm a seasoned interviewer .
( In fact I 'm better at recruiting at doing my real job ... Sigh . )
Let me tell you this : yes , I ( and my fellow Wall Street interviewers ) will ask some of the basic questions you 'll see in this book , but we are lookign for honest , personal answers , not canned ones .
Also , we look for *common sense* .
Trust me , all successful candidates demonstrate common sense , and also each person 's uniqueness ( "what makes you sparkle " ) .
Then , for the difficult questions you 'll likely encounter , you wo n't find in this poorly written , poorly edited book .
It 'll likely confuse you .
Instead , read the Wall Street Journal , read up on finance topics that interest you , and beef up your basic math skills if they are lacking at the moment .
Again , we want smart people who can think , not someone who just fits into a formula .
Of course , many people who do get finance jobs are formula kind of people , but do they get paid a lot ?
I bet not .
