I insert a push pin into the lid .
Put some tape over it , I use the black electrical tape , fold over the end so you can pull up easily each time .
You can do this over and over , no need to try and pry open the lid with a spoon and possibly bend the lid .
Works great !
I use this jar sealer more than the bags .
In fact , I only had a few rolls left when I bought a large box of bags at Costco about 6 months ago .
Have n't even opened that box yet !
I mostly use the bags for freezing meat .
