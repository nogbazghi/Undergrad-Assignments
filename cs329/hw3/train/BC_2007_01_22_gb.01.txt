It means they`re a jerk and they need to study and grow up , be a man and stop acting like a jerk , not go seek out medical attention or , you know , spiritual counseling .
Just stop it .
You know , what kills me is -- I mean , can you even imagine you`ve got the network of the mouse ?
Can you even imagine the ton of bricks that came down on that guy ?
Further controversy is Isaiah Washington is African-American .
The co-star he called the name then came out of the closet and said , " Well , no one knew this before , but I am gay . "
What if that gay had called him the " N" word ?
Would he even had made it to the afternoon ?
I do n` t think so .
No.
The other thing I find interesting is that Washington fired his P.R. person .
Like it was his fault or her fault .
How dare you tell me to lie openly ?
It` s my public -- it` s my public relations people .
They`re all screwed up , and they need help .
And they need everyone` s prayers , I`ll tell you that .
Absolutely .
Dave , thanks a lot .

Welcome to " The Real Story . "
And unless you were hiding in your Election `08 bunker in your basement all weekend long , then I` m sure you`ve heard by now , yes , we have a new candidate , they have announced the formation of an exploratory committee for the `08 Democratic presidential nomination , and they did it by embracing some of that new technology I`ve been hearing so much about , posting a video on their intra-Web site .
Hello .
This is Governor Bill Richardson .
Today I` m announcing the formation of a presidential campaign exploratory committee .
Sure , that` s the one everybody was talking about .
Bill Richardson is in it , and he` s in it to win it , or should I say "ganar it , " since , you know , just about all you`ve heard about Bill Richardson , at least if you`ve been reading the paper this weekend , is apparently he` s Hispanic .
Did n` t know that .
But lost in all the hoopla and excitement over that announcement was the fact that another candidate also forming an exploratory committee -- please , if you`ve just eaten dinner , maybe you have an upset stomach , please avert your eyes .
Watch this .
I announced today that I` m forming a presidential exploratory committee .
I` m not just starting a campaign , though ; I` m beginning a conversation with you , with America .
Ooh !
No offense there , Hillary , but I think I` m going to take a pass on that conversation .
I love so much about this video .
My favorite part , I think , is the way she is acting .
She is acting and telling you it` s very , very -- I`ve been agonizing over this decision .
It` s been very hard to make this decision .
