Yeah , and under the sort of umbrella of anti-terrorist -- anti-terrorism , you know --
Mhm ?
-- all this legislation that is just -- you know , give us license .
Mhm .
Let us do whatever we want .
Yeah .
You 're afraid right now .
Mhm .
This legislation will pass --
Yeah .
I mean , it 's just -- I 'm worried that , uh -- uh , there 's -- there 's going to be a lot of more stuff like that , that you know --
Yeah .
In the face of the sort of immediate fear , you know ?
Mhm .
People will sort of surrender their rights , so it 'll be like , " Yes , make us safe " .
Mhm .
And uh -- and uh , I 'd rather be free --
Yeah .
-- than safe .
Yeah .
I know what you mean .
It 's terrible .
I -- I feel the same way , too .
I -- I was in , um , I actually lived in Vancouver for a few years , Washington --
Okay ?
-- and um , just speaking of terrorism , um , for uh , the millenium , when they cancelled the celebration in Seattle --
Yeah .
-- and I can remember we were thinking about going up there , but then I had just had my son , my son was just a few weeks old at the time and we 're of course clo- closer to Portland and we did n't go to Portland , not only because my son was too little , but just because we were afraid that whoever was in Seattle was going to come down to Portland --
.
-- and that all the people would be coming from Seattle to Portland just because it was , you know , one of the nearer places to go .
Yeah .
And I can remember that , that fear , just -- just , " Oh , I do n't want to leave the house .
I 'm afraid the -- the world 's going to blow up " .
I mean , we watched that TV expecting something to happen in New York City --
Yeah .
-- on -- on the millenium , you know ?
We -- we 're freaked out . .
Yeah .
Yeah .
I can -- I can --
Yeah , absolutely .
I mean , and -- and just , um , the first time I flew after September eleventh , I -- I did n't I 'm not generally , like -- I 'm generally pretty fearless .
Mhm ?
Like , I 've never been , like , afraid to fly .
I do n't -- I 'm not afraid of things .
Like , I 'm not afraid of spiders , you know ?
Oh , I am . .
.
But I -- you know , the first time I flew , first of all , going to the airport and having there be , you know , armed forces there ?
Mhm .
You know ?
Yeah .
Standing at attention with guns was totally surreal .
Yeah .
Um , and -- and then -- and then just , like , realizing that I was actually really , really anxious , just sort of vaguely generally anxious --
