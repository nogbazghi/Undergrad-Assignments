A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 6.9
shook Greece and rattled the eastern Mediterranean on Sunday , damaging
scores of buildings and injuring two people .
The authorities in Athens said the quake , felt as far away
as Jordan , originated from seismic fault lines between the islands
of Kithira and Crete , in southern Greece , and was under
water , at a depth of 43.5 miles .
" We were extremely lucky that this was an underwater earthquake , " said
Giorgos Stavrakakis , director of the Athens Geodynamic Institute .
" Had it
happened on land , it would have been a mess . "
No tsunami warnings were issued .
Still , the authorities said Greece 's civilian
and military forces had been placed on "red alert " because
of strong aftershocks recorded in the region throughout Sunday .
At least two people were injured on Crete while trying to
flee their homes .
About 50 old , unoccupied buildings and a
church collapsed on Kithira , said the regional governor , Yannis Mihas ,
but no casualties were reported .
Clarice Nassif Ransom , spokeswoman for the U.S. Geological Survey in Washington ,
said as many as 6 million people might have felt
Sunday 's earthquake .
