and Sarah Hughes - wo n't be on the ice .
Still ,
she 's not expecting a coronation .
" I do n't take anything for granted at a national championships , " Cohen
says .
" I do n't consider myself to have anything on a
platter . "
She learned her lesson six years ago when she went to
the world junior championships in Germany expecting a walkover after
placing second to Kwan at nationals .
Instead , Cohen finished a
shattered sixth as Newton native Jennifer Kirk came from behind
to win .
" I was devastated , " she confesses .
" Crying , emotional .
It was a reality
shock for me . "
She had been cavalier about the whole week , much too casual ,
she concluded .
Her reaction , consciously or not , took her to
the opposite extreme .
She decided she had to be flawless ,
which merely tightened the squeeze .
Every time she tripped over
her own feet , the more pressure Cohen felt to skate
error-free the next time .
" Fear of making mistakes , " she muses .
" I 've always tried to be
perfect .
I need to stop worrying about being perfect and
just worry about being better . "
Even the nonbelievers acknowledge that Cohen has the whole package .
Except
for the triple axel , which only a handful of women
can land , she has the jumps .
She has the footwork .
Her spins are absolutely ethereal .
Her music , choreography , costumes are
inspired .
But from the day she turned up for her
first nationals at 15 , Cohen has labored in Kwan 's shadow .
" It can be frustrating , " she concedes .
" I went through a time
a couple of years ago when I thought , ' Why does n't
she retire ? ' Look how many nationals she has , look how
many worlds she 's won .
Give someone else a turn .
" But at the same time , it makes you a better skater .
You 're only as good as your competition .
When the field
is weak , then you become weak .
When I do win
a national title , it 'll mean a lot more if she 's
there . "
Not that Cohen has n't beaten Kwan ; she finished ahead of her
at the last two world championships .
Time was when if
you beat Kwan , you ruled the planet , but the world
has gotten decidedly more competitive .
The Japanese are on the
rise .
Slutskaya still has golden stuff at 26 .
Last year ,
an Italian-born skater ( Carolina Kostner ) made the global podium for
the first time .
On her best day , Cohen can beat them all .
She does n't
have to be perfect .
All she has to do is
stand on her own two feet for seven minutes .
That 's
what six years of coming in second has taught her .
" When you win , you do n't analyze , " Cohen says .
" It 's when you
lose , when you skate badly , that you look back and
see what went wrong .
It teaches you to be a
stronger person .
Everyone handles winning great .
It 's when you lose
.. . "
By now , Cohen has won enough silver to have given the
Hunt brothers a run for their money in their day .
She 'd like some of the Fort Knox stash .
No woman
has finished second at the US championships five times , and
