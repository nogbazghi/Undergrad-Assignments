Ten minutes .
Okay .
I 'm not sure whether the robot will let us know .
Oh , it was supposed to be a prompter that comes on .
Is it --
To let us know when the ten minutes has expired .
Right .
Okay .
Well --
It seems like it would be about that much time though now though , does n't it ?
Right , it does .
Um , 'cause -- oh , I do n't have -- I 'm not even -- I do n't even have my clock right here with me .
But , if I remember her correctly , she said there would be a prompter .
Okay .
I did n't know it was going to be like this , like , they called me and then they called you .
Or , had they called you before ?
They called a couple of times before but I was n't available .
Okay .
Okay , 'cause this --
So , when they --
-- okay .
This is my first , ah , call .
Mine too .
Oh , okay .
Okay .
I -- 'cause I had to look for my pin number .
So , now I 'm going to have to keep it out .
Right .
So -- and where are you located ?
I 'm in Chicago .
Okay .
I 'm in Atlanta .
Oh , okay .
Yeah .
So , how 's the weather there ?
It 's kinda grey day today .
Well , actually , it was a beautiful day today .
Well , I believe it reached close to seventy today but the temperature is supposed to drop this evening .
Okay --
And then --
-- and it was seventy yesterday here --
Oh , okay .
--
Well see that 's not unusual for Atlanta , right ?
Um , um , n- I guess this time of the year it 's more of the rainy season .
It 's just been a cloudy day and we 've had , like -- I think they only said like a half an inch of rain .
The temperature --
Okay .
-- is sixty , so the temperature wise is pleasant .
It 's just that it 's a grey day .
Okay .
And yesterday was just absolutely gorgeous .
I mean , for it to be a Sunday -- everybody was out in the parks and just a great day .
I 'm --
-- going to have to put , um , my clock right by this phone too .
So --
Well , I know we have exceeded ten minutes .
Okay .
Okay .
Well , take care .
You too .
Uh-huh .
Bye bye .
