First let me say that I bought this re-usable filter based on user reviews and the idea that I could stop buying the paper filters .
There are a few downsides to using this filter .
When you have finished brewing the coffee there is a silt residue at the bottom of the pot .
It is something akin to the stuff on the bottom of a tea pot .
You will notice a strange metallic taste with this filter .
You have to clean the filter after each use .
Dumping the grounds in the trash can gets most of the grounds , but you have to rinse the filter to clean out the remainder .
I 've had this filter nearly two months and I may go back to paper filters just to make sure the things I 've noted here are directly related to the Gold Tone Filter .
