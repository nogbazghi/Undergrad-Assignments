a powerful vacuum ( 1000w ) that 's fairly quiet and does a fine job on both hardwood floors and rugs .
it 's great around the apartment with its 26 ft long cord .<p>the
miele s143 is solidly constructed without being overly weighty and is nicely balanced .
the head pivots slightly side to side and is actually helpful vacuuming around things like a furniture leg . the head loses full contact somewhat when you bring the vacuum down to the level of the floor in the rug mode -- trying (ummph ) to get deep under the sofa or bed but otherwise but generally does a fine job .<p>the
heart of the s143 can be used with a smaller head/crevice attachment and without the long handle , much like a really powerful hand vac. a very useful feature for cleaning furniture .<p>there is an option to upgrade to a hepa filter ( although the included carbon filter bag is good enough for me ) and i believe an option to upgrade to a motorized head but i suspect if that 's a serious consideration , the s147 is probably the way to go .<p>off tangent : i 'm not sure why the description lists Ivory as the color but the s143 , as far as i know , only comes in the mint green shown in the picture .<p>all in all , a finely built product that 's nicely met the needs of this apartment dweller ... though a tad on the pricey side .
