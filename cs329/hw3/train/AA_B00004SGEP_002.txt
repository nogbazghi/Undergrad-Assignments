The juice extractor does FIT the 9 cup fp , as Kitchenaid says , however , it does n't actually WORK with it .
The attachment sits in the bowl just as it should , it spins around , but the food pusher does not reach down far enough to actually make juice out of your veggies .
Whatever you drop in will simply go straight through without scraping the bottom , as Kitchenaid says it should , and then spin around like mad without making juice .
I spoke with Kitchenaid a couple of times and I am sending it back .
I even tried putting in larger chunks but it just wo n't hold them in place because the pusher and tube extender are not long enough .
I also tried a wooden spoon for a pusher but it did n't help due to the shortness of the tube .
Bottom line , no matter how bad you want this extractor , like I did , do n't get it for a 9 cup processor .
