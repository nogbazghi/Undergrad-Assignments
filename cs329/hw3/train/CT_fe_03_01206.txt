Yeah .
And money seems to be real important but when you get older , it -- it just is n't that important any more .
Yeah .
I mean -- I mean , to -- to me , like , let 's say , Bill Gate right now ...
Mhm .
I mean , money is nothing to him but --
Right .
I mean , there 's a lot of people out there that just does n't , like him .
Uh-huh .
And , like , th - they -- I mean , there are people who just want to get -- get , you know , with them because of his money , you know and you know , you can never find , you know , true friendship or true love that way , you know ?
Mhm .
I just -- and I wonder , you know , how many people , because they have all that money , how many people can he really say are his true friends ?
Yeah .
That do n't have some alternative motive behind , you know , getting close to Bill Gates .
Yeah .
That 's -- that 's true .
And they 'd -- they 'd always be hitting you up .
I mean , who wants money on that -- that amount of money .
I would like to be comfortable ...
Uh-huh .
... and -- and not worry about um whether I 'm gonna pay the PG and E bill next month , you know ?
Yeah .
Or the telephone bill or whatever .
Um ... and I 'd like to have a little bit locked away for , you know , in case you get sick , you ca n't work , you -- you know , th - those kinds of things and -- and build a little bit of a retirement but to have a -- a large amount of money , just think of the -- of the uh headaches that you all -- all of a sudden -- things that you 've never had to deal with before .
Mhm , yeah .
You know ?
That 's true .
I mean --
And I -- and I just do n't think money brings happiness .
I think it just brings a whole bunch of -- of extra problems that you do n't have --
I mean -- enough money to use is happiness .
Uh-huh .
But -- but when you have too much money , then , you know , you always have to watch your back , you know ?
Right .
Right .
Right .
So , why would I give up my best friend ...
... you know , that I have now , I can depend on ...
For -- for a million bucks .
... to have a million bucks and have a bunch of people that I have to watch my back with .
Yeah .
I mean , does n't make any sense .
I -- I mean , you know , like , the -- the part of having a best friend that money ca n't buy is that ... like if -- if you 're in trouble , like , you went bankruptcy , you know ?
