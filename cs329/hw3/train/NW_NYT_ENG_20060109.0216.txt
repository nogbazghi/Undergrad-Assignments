Denver -- David Harrison , Erick Dampier and David Wesley have taken
their shots at Carmelo Anthony 's ribs since he bruised them
last week .
Considering his history with the Nuggets forward , Phoenix
guard Raja Bell seems almost certain to follow suit Tuesday
night .
But Anthony vowed Monday to play while making exactly zero adjustments
to his game .
" All I know is pain , baby , " he said .
" I fight through
pain . "
That attitude helped Anthony disregard pointed jabs from Wesley before he
hit the game-winning jump shot with one tick left in
his team 's 92-90 win at Houston Sunday .
Wesley confessed after
the game that he knew he was sending his elbows
to where Anthony hurt .
The pain was obvious over the
final six minutes when a grimace rarely left Anthony 's face .
Coach George Karl said Anthony ignores injury until the final buzzer
as well as anyone on his team .
" Unfortunately , ribs are in a place where you 're moving a lot
when you shoot , when you run , when you jump , " he
said .
" But as the game goes on , adrenaline , passion , enthusiasm ,
intensity usually blocks out pain . "
Anthony guessed he would wear a larger protective vest than normal
against Phoenix .
While he shied away from running post plays
against the Rockets , he said he would not limit any
part of his game Tuesday , adding that the only way
he would n't play was if he could n't run .
With big men Nene and Marcus Camby already out with injuries ,
power forward Kenyon Martin appears set to join them .Back spasms
limited Martin to nine minutes in Houston .
Still , Anthony said he wo n't consider playing with more caution .
" If I think like that , we 're going to be messed up
anyway , because I would be hesitant to do some things , "
he said .
