So , why -- why should I even waste my time worrying about it ?
Right .
' Cause that 's what the- that 's their -- I think that 's their main go , anyway , is to scare everybody .
Right .
To get into our minds or whatever ?
That 's right . .
.
Our minds , our lives , and everything else .
Right .
And it -- I think it certainly has , um , you know , changed like at the airport and what not , where my husband went through they -- you know , did the baggage check and things like that .
No, I -- I mean , it seemed like an inconvenience , but it 's a good thing , too , that they 're taking all the extra precautions about it .
I do think that I 'm more cautious about -- you know , like this SARS ?
Uh-huh .
It kind of makes you -- or -- or even like when the [inaudible ] --
Uh-huh .
Was come -- it -- it makes you wonder if they did n't cause that somehow , you know , like by selecting mosquitos and injecting them with something and then releasing them over here , you know ?
I -- I know it 's --
Right .
-- bizarre , but --
Right , it --
-- I -- it 's stuff like that just pops in my mind and so , you know , when one of mine gets a cold , I 'm like --
Yeah , you just have a suspicion of --
Yeah , and --
-- what --
-- you -- you do n't know if they 're going to get into the food lines , so you -- you -- I -- I do a lot of organic gardening .
Uh-huh .
Which , you know , is not going to do no good if the ground gets radiation in it .
Right .
But --
That 's -- so you have a two year old ?
Um , I have a two year old , a twenty three year old and an eighteen year old .
Oh , okay . .
And two grandchildren .
Okay .
So you started from scratch ? .
.
Well , my -- my second husband --
Uh-huh .
-- did n't have children and so that 's why we had the two year old . .
Well , that 's great , though .
Yeah .
And I did n't really get to raise my two .
Uh-huh .
So , that 's what -- you know , like I said , after September eleventh , I was like , you know , I really would like to home school her because I would hate for something to happen and her not be with me , you know ?
Right .
Right .
It 's just -- maybe I 'm over protective , but --
Right .
That 's -- I guess that were some of my precautions were more towards my children and worrying about them and even with them watching TV , they have a , um , child at the elementary school that I guess is -- I 'm not sure what -- it -- he wears the drape clothing and stuff , and it -- even the young kids , you know , were suspicious towards him and I try to teach them to not be prejudiced , but it 's -- when they see all that on TV , it 's hard for them , even as kids , to not think things about it .
