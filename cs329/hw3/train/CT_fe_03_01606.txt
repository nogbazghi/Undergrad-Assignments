Yeah .
As a -- as a weapon that would -- that would bypass metal detectors , so ...
Mhm .
Yeah .
I also think it 's interesting 'cause this is something fairly recent within the past few months .
It 's our airline , so no longer -- like actually on the flight you ca n't have a line forming from the bathroom any more .
Oh , is that true ?
I did n't know that .
Yeah .
So , like if there 's somebody in the lavatory they have that little light on the --
Right .
-- ceiling and --
Uh-huh .
-- you ca n't stand up unless you need to just stretch or something .
Oh , I did n't know that , so you ca n't go back --
You they 're getting -- you ca n't just walk around like you used to if you need to stretch or anything any more .
Oh , I did n't know that .
Yeah .
Oh , I did n't --
Makes it bad for long flights .
Right , yeah .
Well , and some people -- you know if y- -- some people have medical conditions and need to get up and walk around and stuff , so --
Mhm .
Oh , that 's inter- --
Yeah , maybe if you let the airline know in advance for medical they might allow it --
Uh-huh .
-- but , not sure about if you do n't let them know .
I did n't know that .
Is -- was that just across the board or is that just in certain airlines ?
Um , it 's an FAA thing .
Oh --
So --
Oh .
' Cause I 've flown Southwest quite a few times and --
Uh-huh .
-- every time they say , " Due to new like FAA regulations we are no longer allowed to people do this " .
Oh , wow , see I have n't flown recently so -- sin- since they 've done that , so I 'd never heard that before .
That 's interesting .
I guess they do n't want people loitering in the isle way , huh ?
Mhm .
Yeah , o - okay , uh ...
And then like inside the airport , um -- I go into the Salt Lake one for a connecting flight and they had one of those [inaudible ] diners there --
Mhm .
-- and I was kinda surprised 'cause they gave you plastic silverware 'cause they 're not allowed to give out metal silverware any more .
In -- on the plane , or in the actual , uh --
Um , in the airport .
So --
Oh , in the airplane , so they do n't want you -- oh , oh that makes sense .
So , like you went there and ordered like -- somebody in my group ordered like a mini steak --
Uh-huh .
-- and then they got plastic silverware and they were kinda like , " How am I supposed to cut this ? "
Like , " Well , we do n't have any sharp knives in the back either , so --
