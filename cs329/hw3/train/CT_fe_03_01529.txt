Not for no two year olds .
Unless you do it in the house .
Yeah , but --
You know , you can hide 'em in the house somewhere .
You know , like under --
Yeah .
-- a chair .
' Cause I bought my daughter to one today and they -- they set it up inside and they put like grass , you know , fake grass and fake gates and stuff .
Uh-huh .
And they hid 'em under the grass .
Oh , okay .

I always hear it goes by quick so --
Huh ?
I always -- everybody tell me it goes by quick , you know , like when they 're little and to enjoy the time you have with them when they 're small because it goes by quick .
Yeah .
' Cause I already know that it went by , you know , her fourteen months and -- went by quick for me .
Did you even look at the clock when that -- we got connected ?
Uh , no , I did n't , um --
Me neither .
Are they gonna come back and say ten minutes is up ?

Uh-huh .

Oh , she did ?
Yeah , and that 's why I 'm wondering but I did hear , you know , they did say they 're let us know when the ten minutes is up .
Oh .
Yeah , I did n't look .

I would say -- yeah , because it 's still recording --
