I got a copy of this book from a friend .
It was the right size ( ~250 pages ) for me to be able to have a hope to read it cover to cover .
When i started going through the lessons and labs , i realized that seemingly hard topics in T-SQL suddenly became trivial .
I got more out of these 250 pages , than a few of the 1000 page 'bible ' books i bought .
