FYI - item was purchased at Target , but the review needs to be written .
First of all , I did my research and decided to go to Bed Bath and Beyond to purchase .
Once I got there , they had a total of one kind of humidifier compared to the many that were available online .
I had my coupon , was ready to spend more on a better humidifier .
Plus , I needed one that day , and didnt want to wait 5-6 days for shipping .
Fine , I head over to Target and purchase this one .
First time i turned it on , it leaked .
I thought it was just a one time deal .
Nope , woke up this morning to a soaked carpet .
The humidifier was on top of a small entertainment center , not on the floor .
Will be returning this item immediately to Target .
Very disappointed .
