" The Shield " opens its fifth season in typically attention-grabbing fashion --
with a brawl at a funeral , followed in short order
by a brawl at a high school .
It 's an all-out
race war , and while tax cuts may be stretching the
cops at the Barn thin , all this just gives Vic
Mackey ( Michael Chiklis ) more leeway to spread his special brand
of tough love .
Forest Whitaker joins the cast as an
Internal Affairs investigator determined to bring Vic down -- yeah ,
we 've heard that one before , but Vic has n't exactly quit
digging that hole he 's in -- and he 's getting grief
from several directions .
Five years in , " The Shield " has hardly
lost any of its grit and attitude .
It returns at
10 tonight on FX .
