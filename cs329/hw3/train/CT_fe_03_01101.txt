-- you know , hire people to administer the tests and things like that .
So --
Right .
Well , you can always start on your own , right , and then -- or if you know somebody that has a similar interest , you know , bring them in and then you could start off small and then make it bigger and it does n't have to exactly be Caplin , but it could be something you design --
Uh-huh .
-- out of your own head .
Yeah .
So .
I know you make a lot more money usually if you own your business , but every business owner I 've seen does the -- like you say , have , you know , they 're totally tied to the business and --
-- do n't have a lot of free time .
Yeah .
That 's it , you know --
-- you 've got to choose .
It 's either quality of life which is , you know , you check out at five , you 're done , or , ah , you know , you -- you 're tied to the -- but you know what , all in all , I have to say between the two -- because I work for a b - -- a company now and , um , I 'm not -- not happy at all .
Uh-huh .

I 've been looking to leave for the six years I 've been there so I mean , I -- after running a business , your time is yours and , um , there 's nothing more gratifying at the end of the day than saying , you know , I did this , I created this and --
Mhm .

You know --
Yeah .
-- every day can be a new experience , something new you learn about it , um , when you 're working for someone else it 's always the same crap year after year .
Yeah .
You know --
I think that is a --
-- same people --
-- benefit , that it 's a creative process , so --
Absolutely .
-- whatever you can --
And that 's --
-- dream .
-- that 's the spiritual journey of it all .
Yeah .
Yeah .
So , it 's just the money part that holds you back --
Uh-huh .
-- you know .
So , that 's --
I have a -- a friend who 's a -- an artist in Tucson and , ah , we would always dream -- this is a few years ago when we still lived in the same city -- but we always dreamed that she 'd have sort of like this coffee shop sort of place but it would also be , ah , a place for her to exhibit her own art --
Excellent .
-- and , ah , she was going to make it like a replica of the Taj Mahal --
-- there in the middle of the desert in Tucson , so --
