Kurt Vonnegut has died .
So it goes .
From Dead Eye Dick : âIt may be a bad thing that so many people try to make good stories out of their lives .
A story after all is as artificial as a mechanical bucking bronco in a drinking establishment .
And it may be even worse for nations to try to be characters in stories .
Perhaps these words should be carved over doorways of the United Nations and all sorts of parliaments , big and small : LEAVE YOUR STORY OUTSIDE.â 
Oh , and will everyone stop using the word âcountercultureâ  about him .
Whether itâs intended as praise or insult or condescension , itâs simply wrong : Vonnegut was the epitome of American culture .
Almost immediately after hearing that news , I read something that Vonnegut would surely have had something to say about : some of those BYU students protesting Dick Cheney being their commencement speaker are evidently upset only at his use of profanity when he told Patrick Leahy to go fuck himself .
Also , I hear he sometimes indulges in the Demon Caffeine .
