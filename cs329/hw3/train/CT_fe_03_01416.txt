And , unfortunately , I think that 's what 's going to happen here .
That it 's gonna be --
Yeah .
Well , I guess , I think you have to be open to it .
Yeah .
To -- like I say what 's kind of -- and I think probably -- it 's probably what 's going on in a person 's life --
Yeah .
-- and probably age , like you pointed out --
Yeah .
-- you know , like I 'm forty four right now --
Mhm .
-- and I think , you know , as you 're older you start looking kind of and evaluating your life a little bit more .
Mhm .
Whereas , I think , when you 're a little younger you 're kinda like living here and now and now and not necessarily looking at those types of things .
Mhm .
And to make changes in your life and your -- in what you 're doing and everything else .
Yeah .
So --
Did it -- did it impact people in your family , in your community , in a way where you saw lasting changes or ... ?
Not really .
I mean , the only thing I was concerned about is that I had a brother who -- who travels quite a bit and travels to New York and I knew he was out of town but I just did n't know where .
Mhm .
And he actually -- well , he happened to be on an airplane that day --
Oh my Jesus , mercy .
-- and , um , flew in to Florida --
Uh-huh .
-- and I asked him , I said , " Well , you know , what -- what was that like ? " because they were , I think , still in the air when all this was kinda going on .
Mhm .
And he said -- he said he landed and he said the one thing he noticed , um , was that there was somebody with , like , a machine gun at the airport .
Mhm .
And he really did n't think too much about it .
He thought , " Well , maybe something 's going on locally " .
Mhm .
And then , of course , he found out , you know , later on what -- what happened and everything but , you know , that was kinda weird .
It was just kinda like -- you know , and that was kind of scary because I was trying to get a hold of my sister in law and to find out what -- you know , during that whole day 'cause , you know , the telephone circuits were just so busy that day .
Oh yeah .
And trying to get through to people and then I was trying to get through to my sister in law and she was actually at a doctor 's appointment and so it was just kinda like this whole stressful day of just making sure that , you know , he was okay .
And -- and thankfully he was and was n't really anywhere near , you know , anything that had happened but it was enough to kind of put some stress in , you know , and just be worried .
And , like you said , to kind of reassess and , you know , take a look at those family relationships .
I feel like I 've made more of an effort to be closer to my family --
