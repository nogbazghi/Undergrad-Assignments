This hand blender has the power of an out board motor .
I do n't know why I never bought one for myself before .
I cook a roast with onions , carrots and celery .
They are very limp after cooking so I blended them all together to add to the gravy .
It enhances the flavor tremendously .
This blender will blend vegetables for a soup , like butternut squash to a great consistency .
Just put this thing right into the pot .
It saves so much hassle with transferring hot things to a blender .
If you think you might use this little blender , buy it , you 'll be glad you did .
