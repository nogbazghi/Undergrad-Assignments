This set is tricky to find in a complete state .
Most sets I 've seen are missing the 4 part cardstock referee 's screen .
In fact , usually the first dozen listings on Amazon are just the World Book of Ansalon , shame on those sellers .
Buyer Beware !
A complete Tales of the Lance box set contains :
* World Book of Ansalon ( 176 pages ) * 4 part , tri-fold cardstock referee 's screen * 3 fold-out maps * 16-page pull-apart cardstock book ( includes 40 character cards , 40 fold-up characters , 55-card Talis deck and 3 pages of accessories ) .
