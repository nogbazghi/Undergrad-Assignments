This attachment is the best tool I 've ever purchased for my KitchenAid mixer .
It has made making applesauce and apple butter this year a snap .
No more grinding by hand with a Foley food mill .
This attachment is easy to set up and clean up .
If I had known how much work it saved I would have bought it a long time ago .
Worth every penny .
