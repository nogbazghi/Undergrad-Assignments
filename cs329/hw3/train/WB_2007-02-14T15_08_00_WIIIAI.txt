Today Bush met with Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf .
He did not use her as a pillow , and it showed .
He pointed out that this was the second time theyâd met : âThe first time we met you were wondering whether or not it was possible to achieve your dreams , and you asked for our help .â 
For example , that dream she had about shaking hands with a talking monkey .
