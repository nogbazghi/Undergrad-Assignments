Do n't you think they 're gonna continue trying ?
I -- yeah , I do because I think ...
Especially after this war .
Yeah .
I ...
They will .
Yes .
We made a lot of enemies with this war I think .
Mhm .
So , I think terrorism will always be utmost in the American person minds when they travel , um , not just by air , but at all levels .
Mhm .
I think -- especially by air because you can get so many people at one time .
Mhm .
But ...
And I saw on the news yesterday that , um , they were labor- laboring the , um , San Francisco Brid - -- the Golden Gate Bridge --
-- is one of the second highest threat .
Wow !
So , you know , the airports they can get so many more people in one place like that .
So , now they 're gonna have to shift .
I do n't know .
They will always come at us , I think , in the future .
Mhm .
But just open the gateway and to me it 's a revolving door .
Well , it 's just a very different world because of that , you know ?
Oh , most definitely .
Yeah .
But you know the sad part about it ?
Uh-uh .
It wo n't ever go back to being the way it used to be .
No.
No.
Yeah .
No. Terrorism will be a part of our life until the day we die .
Mhm .
You know ?
I think it 'll just heighten because -- I do n't think it will go away .
Why would it go away if someone thought they 'd made such a big ruckus over here ?
Yeah .
They -- they could do --
Well , of course .
-- so much with so few people .
Of course .
Yes .
And I do n't think they 're gonna be just , you know , picking us off the block but , you know , there 's somebody out there , I would think several somebody 's , who think that they can get away with it .
Yeah .
You know , the way people 's minds are ?
Mhm .
But I would hate for that to happen again .
Yeah .
I mean , so much is going on , you know ?
Yeah .
Yeah .
' Cause it 's not only without , it 's even within our own people , with the -- you know , like the guy who did that thing in Kansas City when they blew up the Government Building , you know ?
Yeah .
And I -- I think that was some of our problem too .
Uh , we did n't have , um , our import and export areas , you know , tight enough .
Mhm .
That said a lot about our way of thinking .
To me .
You know , that 's just the w- --
Yeah .
We 're very naive , you mean ?
I 'm sorry ?
We 're very naive as , uh ...
