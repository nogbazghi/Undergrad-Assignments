I 'd be like , " Oh my God , what 's going on ? " and --
I -- it 's one of those situations you ca n't imagine yourself in .
Right , exactly .
You know .
Mhm .
And , like , if it ever happened to me , like , okay , I have to deal with it , I do n't really have any choice like , that -- just li- -- ah , you know --
Right .
-- it 's here and I have to deal with it .
But ...
Mhm .
It 's -- it 's rough , I mean , it 's definitely --
And , I mean --
[several inaudible words ] .
And now they 're talking about -- now they 're talking about , you know , +possibility -- possibility of going to war with Syria and they 've got all this crap going on in North Korea .
And it 's like , " Oh my God , is my husband ever coming home ? "
It 's like , and he 's just gets it , " That 's it , you 're not going back any more after this .
That 's it " .
Oh my God .
Yeah , I me- Like --
Like , get a --
They better --
-- civilian job , ha-ha .
They better cut him loose .
Because it 's like we were -- we were trying to think of , you know , 'cause he was all getting worried like , um , 'cause he -- he did n't leave that long ago probably about a couple of weeks ago .
And , you know , he was talking about , " Well , I 'm going to come back down to Florida " 'cause he was stationed at -- in Washington DC .
Okay .
And , um , you know , he was talking about , " Oh , I 'm gonna get a security job down there " and everything .
Then ah , see you later .
Mhm .
You know .
" Got to run " .
And I was like , " Oh my God , what am I gonna do ? "
But it 's -- it 's hard for our son .
He 's only three , you know , and he does n't understand , you know , where daddy is .
He just -- each time you ask him he just says , " Daddy 's at work " you know .
So ...
He 's like , " Does n't he ever get off of work ?
He 's always at work" .
Yeah .
Yeah .
And they used to -- and they used to , um -- you know , he saw him , mm , let 's see , in January for his birthday and , you know , they started to get really bonded again , you know .
Mhm .
They had n't seen each other in a few months and it 's -- it 's like and then they talk on the phone every so often .
And then now , you know -- you know , he 's like , " Where 's daddy ? "
And I 'm like -- and it breaks my heart 'cause I 'm like , " I do n't know " you know .
Yeah .
Can he do , like , emails ?
Are they able to do that or ... ?
Yeah , every so of - -- you know , I think pretty much things have calmed down there and he 's in Military Police so , I mean , it 's not like he 's , you know , right out there .
But , you know , he 's still in the midst but ... What ?
But , you know , he kn- -- he knows that daddy 's a cop and he knows daddy 's a policeman .
But , you know .
And he 's like , " I do n't know where my daddy is " you know .
I feel so bad for him .
