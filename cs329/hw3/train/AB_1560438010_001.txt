One of the things I dislike about reading TD Jakes is that there is a certain emphasis on "working your way into heaven . "
It is unfortunate that there are actually people who believe you can do this or you have to do this and that grace is n't enough .
However , that does n't mean that his books need to be ignored , or there 's not any good advice in them .
For far too long there has been an emphasis in the Christian church on this "poor old me I 'm a sinner " mindset .
Nowhere in the new testament does it ever show Jesus being miserable , and the old testament saints , for the most part , were healthy , happy , and rich .
I think that 's one of the reasons you also see such a rebellion in the church these days .
Many Christians , including myself , are tired of being told that life is miserable .
Who wants to be a miserable Christian ?
The Garden of Eden certainly was n't a place of misery , and I do n't think God put us here to be miserable .
In fact , after putting us here to have a relationship with Him , we are here to prosper .
This is why it 's important to read the kind of books TD Jakes writes .
Although you do n't have to try so hard , you do need to understand the principles he is talking about .
Principles like prosperity , as well as cultivating the right mindset .
What so many Christians need to understand about God , and especially prayer , is that even if you pray for something , but you do n't believe God will give it to you , God wo n't ignore what you really believe .
He wo n't ignore your free will .
If you want to be blessed , then you need to change your mindset .
This book will help you do that .
What TD Jakes will show you how to do is change your mindset .
Survive the peaks and valleys of getting from where you are to where you and God both want you to be .
To achieve what it is you want , and never give up in the process of trying .
In other words , this book is about teaching you how to persevere .
Persevere , and you will succeed .
