I would write a detailed review on why I did n't like this book , but it 's not worth it to waste more time on a book that took so much of it from me already .
Suffice to say , the plot is boring and the overriding theme of NASA possibly being shut down due to the action or inaction of certain characters is duller than a roll of toilet paper .
I highly doubt the possible privatization of NASA ( or keeping it a government agency ) is enough to keep most readers interested , and that is the focal point of the novel .
The characters are dull .
Not so much characters as caricatures .
The only reason I made it though this book is because , like other Brown novels , it is so easy to read .
Even though it 's boring and contrived , you can easily make it through 50 pages a night and be done with it in a week .
Of course , you could just skip it altogether and save yourself the anguish and frustration .
