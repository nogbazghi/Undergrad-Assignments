First , I am reviewing the meat-grinding part only .
And for that I give this attachment five stars .
I 've used mine for at least 15 years and it has always performed flawlessly in that aspect .
I am now noticing stress cracks around the part that inserts into the machine , but as long as it does n't break I see no need to replace it .
Every time the news buzzes with yet another ground meat recall I ca n't help but breathe a sigh of relief that I know for sure that my batches of ground meat contain only one cow and not hundreds , which reduces the chance of salmonella contamination significantly .
This is probably my most-used KitchenAid attachment .
I ca n't imagine life without it ...
