This is one you gotta get and keep.
Once you get yer hands on it , no way will you depart with it .
The thing just commands respect .
I hate to sound like some nerd but i am blown away but the size and thickness of this thing .
Hardcover monstrosity !
Tons of images , tales , opinions all with a wild graphic yet not "arty " layout and design .
i actually wish there was more writing and theories since the guys behind it and the hardcore celebs featured seem very interesting in their writing .
But i 'll take all the visuals .
hey , all us hardcore kids like books with big pictures !
