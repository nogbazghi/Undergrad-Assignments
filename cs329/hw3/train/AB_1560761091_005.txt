I thouroughly enjoyed this book .
It contains accurate , relevant ,and useful data pertaining to any and all equipment , weapons , armor , and other miscelaneous things necessary in order to create an historically-accurate gaming experience .
Some of the areas could have used more fleshing-out , and some cultures ' implements have not been described as well as they should have been , the book is probably the best that could be done in the space alotted .
