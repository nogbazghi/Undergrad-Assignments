Rabbi Kula explores human longings for truth , purpose , love , creativity , and inner peace .
He pushes us to accept the struggle as part of a never-ending process .
He encourages us to embrace and learn from wandering , roadblocks , dead-ends , and the detours we may take to navigate the roads of life .
This could be an emotionally challenging read , more relatable in some chapters than others , but ultimately rich in insight and uncommon wisdom .
