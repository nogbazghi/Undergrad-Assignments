...Based on other Amazon reviews I was optimistic that the , 3 liter.Zojirushi Premier Air PotÂ® could hold temperature for an extended period of time .
To test this I prewarmed the vacuum glass with a cup of 210 F water for about 5 minutes .
Then I removed the water and added about 40 ounces ( 12 cups by the marks on the makers pot ) of freshly made , 175 degree Fahrenheit , coffee right out of the coffee maker .
A second measurement 3 hours later , using a UEI PDT550 digital thermometer , showed a 146 degree F temperature .
As I like my coffee hot this 10 degree per hour temperature loss was too great and I returned the Zojirushi to Amazon .
...The next morning , about 12 hours later , the temperature was an undrinkable 105 degrees F and had to be reheated .
Otherwise the pump worked well .
...On a second point : Amazon continues to deliver the Zojirushi poorly packed requiring two shipments to get one pot into my home in tact .
The first , as others have reported , arrived with the vacuum liner broken to shards .
...Finally , Amazon backed the transaction fully and was very quick with replacements and returns .
