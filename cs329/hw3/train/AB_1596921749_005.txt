I like detective novels .
Usually I do n't think such books should run much over 400 pages .
If they do , they have to be very well-written and amusing .
This book fulfills that requirement rather nicely .
Mike Lomax and his partner , Terry Biggs , have been assigned to solve a murder at the local theme park .
The author , Marshall Karp , has obviously worked in Hollywood for years , and has created a fictional movie studio with an attached theme park and a series of cartoon characters , the best known of which is Rambunctious Rabbit .
As a result , the studio is known as the Rabbit Factory by studio insiders .
For those who do n't know , in reality people in Hollywood sometimes say they "work for the Mouse " when they 're employed by Disney .
Disney Studios is sometimes known as " the Mouse House " .
If you read carefully , you can see elements of Disney , Universal Studios , and perhaps Paramount or Warner Brothers in the composite studio that Karp has created .
The killing Lomax and Biggs are working on is that of one of the guys hired to play Rambunctious Rabbit around the studio 's theme park , Familyland .
It soon develops that the guy was a child molester who had managed to buy a new identity .
When another person gets killed , and then yet another , it becomes apparent that someone has it in for the studio itself , and Lomax and Biggs have to race to solve the crime quickly , for fear the whole studio could be destroyed .
Karp has created two interesting characters in Lomax and Biggs .
Biggs is a happy guy with a bad sense of humor , and his counterpart , the story 's narrator Lomax , is a more morose , quiet guy , following the death of his wife .
The two characters play well off of one another , and the resulting story is intelligent and well-told .
I enjoyed this book a great deal , and would recommend it .
