Bush gave another pre-Latin-American-tour interview , with CNN En EspaÃÂ±ol ( funny , there is nât a Fox En EspaÃÂ±ol , is there ? ) , in which he made it clear that what he really wants if for the citizens of those countries to thank him for his munificence .
He said that American aid to Latin America has doubled under him , âand most of that aid is social justice money .â 
Iâll leave it to someone else to figure out how much of that increase actually went to Colombia , the largest recipient of US aid in the region , so that itâs right-wing- death-squad - associated government ( in yesterdayâs interview , Bush said that Uribe is doing a âfabulousâ  job ) to fight rebels under the guise of fighting drug production .
The problem is , according to His Chimpyness , âAnd yet , we donât get much credit for it .
And I want the taxpayers , I want the American people to get credit for their generosity in Central and South America .â 
He returned to that point several times : âThe trip really is to remind people that we care .â 
âAnd itâs in our interest that we promote those ties , and we promote -- and I remind people about the generosity of our country .â 
He said about one American womanâs time with our neighbors to the south , âher example is what America is all about .â 
That woman , of course , is Jenna Bush .
Sheâs writing a book , you know .
Evidently , Jenna is âdeeply concerned about alienationists in our world .â 
I have no idea what that means .
Anyone ?
On other matters , Bush was asked about Scooter Libby ( at first I wrote âBush was asked about Scooter , â  and then went back and added âLibbyâ  in the interests of clarity , like there are any number of Scooters he might be asked about .
On the other hand , itâs possible that every third person in Skull and Bones was called Scooter ) .
He said , âOn a personal note , I was sad .
I was sad for a man who had worked in my administration , and particularly sad for his family .â 
He must have been sad ( past tense , you âll notice ) : he used the word three times .
What does nât seem to make him sad is the treatment of wounded American service members .
Asked what he would say to veterans screwed over at Walter Reed , he whittered on about the Dole-Shalala commission and how there are âfantastic doctors and nurses and healersâ  and so on , but he did nât really seem to have anything he wanted to say to the soldiers â  âIâm sorry we let you downâ  might have been nice .
Iâve been reminded of a visit he made at the start of last year to Brooke Army Medical Center .
My blog post on the visit showed him having a fine old time and joking about a scratch he had on his forehead from âcombat with a cedar .â 
I did nât know until later that heâd just been visiting amputees .
Why did he say he was going to Central and South America , again ?
Oh yes , â I bring a message of hope , a message that says we care about the human conditionâ .
His is an outsiderâs perspective on that condition .
