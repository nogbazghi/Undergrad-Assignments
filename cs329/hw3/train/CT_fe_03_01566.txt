Yeah .
' Cause once in a while you think well , gee , they 're getting such a mountain , they 're not playing that good tonight , maybe or today , you know ?
Yeah , that 's true .
Maybe they do n't care anymore 'cause they know they 're gonna get such a high wage anyway that ...
Yeah .
That 's what -- like , you know , or -- you -- you see Randy Moss playing in one game he does n't play good , and I 'm , like , you know , " What the hell are you getting paid for then ? "
Yes .
And exactly .
Look at the example he 's setting for the young people and the dumb things he does once in a while .
It 's like --
-- I mean , he should be , uh , you know , setting a better example for our young people .
Absolutely .
' Cause -- 'cause all the kids are , s - you know , so into sports and they 'll -- they 'll idolize people like Randy Moss and Kevin Garnett , and if these people are going to set examples like , you know , getting into crime and stuff , it 's not good .
No.
Yeah .
So ...
It 's -- it 's nice , it 's nice to discuss , you know , topics like these with some people you do n't know .

No. Well , you[ ? ] see me when they called me the first time I -- I really , you know , I was so --
I had n't even got the email back yet as to what is expected of me .
So , I really flobbed that one up 'cause I did n't know what to say or do .
I had no idea .
I guess the day before it was about nine eleven , so -- or ni- -- you know , nine one one .
Oh , okay .
And , uh , does -- does --
Uh , not nine one nine .
Nine eleventh , you know ?
So ...
Yeah .
Oh , it was , uh , it was about nine eleven ?
Yes .
Oh .
Uh , how it 's changed your life or ...
Oh , okay .
So , does this go off on its own , or do you hang up or ... ?
No, in -- in ten minutes they 'll tell us , you know , and then you say goodbye and say , you know , talk about what [inaudible] , you know ?
Oh , okay .
Pretty much what -- what we 've said already , you know ?
