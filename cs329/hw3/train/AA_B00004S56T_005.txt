Bought this a couple of weeks back , and I am very happy overall .
Having gone through several thermos with lackluster performance , I was hoping this one would be better .
I was surprised and very pleased .
With a three liter capacity there 's plenty of water to go around now .
Pros :
1 .
Sturdy construction , very well put together ,
2.
Keep contents hot over 24+ hours .
3.
Easy to clean stainless steel exterior .
Cons .
1 .
Glass thermos interior , may not be suitable for rough handling .
2.
Plastic water recovery pipe , which will remain immersed in the hot water .
I fixed this by getting an 8 inch length of copper tube , of 3/8 inch diameter , and replaced the plastic pipe with it .
I would give this 4 stars , and point 2 on the Cons list , is what kept it from getting a full 5 .
I would have thought that Zojirushi would have understood that plastic and hot water do n't do well together .
