I love this book !
I have read it at least three times .
In the early 1500s , Sarah Poyntz , the daughter of a merchant in Antwerp , Belgium , is caught up in the life of William Tyndale .
Because of his work in translating the Bible into English , he is a wanted man .
Although it puts them in deadly peril , Sarah 's family shelters him from his enemies .
Sarah Poyntz , the heroine of the book , risks her life to take an English Bible to the court of Henry VIII .
Although the king is hostile to letting the Bible be printed in English , eventually he relents .
This book is excellent story of a young girl 's courage , and it is based on truth as well .
