Right .
Like , what their stand - -- I 'd say it was pretty much , uh , anti war .
Most of the people that are in the department , there are very few Americans .
Right .
They 're primarily Europeans and actually a fair number of , uh , of Turks and so --
Really ?
Uh , yeah , they 're , uh , Turks and , uh , large group from , uh , South Korea .
Uh-huh .
So , yeah , they --
Are they outspoken on their opinion of America or are they kinda ... ?
Um , not Amer- -- you know , I 've only rec- -- I received some emails from a couple of people where they have , uh , petitions that they -- they want signed --
Mhm .
-- um , to , um , just say , " Sign on .
We 're academics against war " and --
Right .
-- uh , things like that .
So , but usually the topic does n't come up much , uh --
Right .
-- in -- I -- I do n't know .
I guess it -- it is really multi national , the department .
Right .
I mean , we do have a lot of Chinese people from --
Mhm .
-- uh , m - -- we actually figured it out that I think it -- the -- the -- a big group there is -- is actually Korean , so ...
Right .
That 's been kinda , yeah , the attitude around here .
Now , what 's your -- how 's the campus newspaper ?
I mean , do you feel like the students are informed or ... ?
You know , it 's hard to --
How do they cover it ?
-- consider if anyone 's -- I do -- I do pick up the -- the student newspaper .
Um , in general , uh , I 'd say there are -- there have been a few articles , uh , uh , by conservatives that have been printed , a few editorials .
Really ?
And I read those , um --
Now , is the -- you -- is the newspaper there , like -- like , I know the one here at U of I , um , it 's independent , so it 's not owned by the University .
Oh .
So , it 's very -- it 's very -- I guess you could say it 's the opposite of that .
I mean , it 's very liberal , like , very -- I do n't know .
I 'd say neutral actually .
Well , no , I was gonna say that they -- they have two newspapers that you pick up on campus .
Uh-huh .
They have , uh , like , a newspaper that 's kind of your a - -- non official newspaper , I guess .
We call that one the Trojan Horse , um , at USC.
Uh-huh .
And that one is -- is really quite liberal and the regular newspaper is just liberal .
So ...
Really ?
Yeah , it 's -- I -- that 's -- that 's the way it strikes me --
Right .
-- in just having picked it up , that it 's -- it 's a lib - --
