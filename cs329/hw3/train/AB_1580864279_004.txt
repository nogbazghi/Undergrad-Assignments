This is a beautiful book that encourages children to learn about their world .
Information is provided in bits , making it easy for children to digest .
In addition , the internet links provide unlimited learning on the topics in the book .
As far as the person who complained that they showed a photo of NYC without the World Trade Centers , I think you need to be aware that the book was published in 2002 and the WTC no longer was there , nor will ever be there in the future .
Do n't we need to depict the here and now truth in our books for children ?
