The agreement forming the new Hamas-Fatah Palestinian government includes a standard phrase that there is a right to resist Israeli occupation .
The United States opposes this , a State Dept spokesmodel saying , âThe national unity governmentâs platform reference to the right of resistance is disturbing and contradicts the Quartet principles of renunciation of violenceâ .
So it is official US policy that Israeli occupation of and military actions in Palestine may not be resisted .
The LAT has an editorial about the 2,264 ethnic Japanese people that the US took from Latin America , mostly from Peru , during World War II and interned in Texas .
13 countries cooperated with the US in this mass kidnapping , usually without putting anything down on paper , since it so blatantly violated international law .
A few of them were exchanged for Americans captured by Japan , some were still interned in 1948 , and very few were ever allowed to return to the countries that had connived in their seizure .
When the US started paying reparations to interned Japanese-Americans in 1990 , it refused to pay these internees ( eventually some did get paid , 1/4 as much ) for the reason â  which the LAT does nât make clear enough â  that they had been ... illegal immigrants .
Moving on without any ironic segue whatsoever , Republicans are gearing up to object to any move to close down Guantanamo and move those prisoners into US military brigs on the mainland .
Various congresscritters are saying they donât want them in Florida or South Carolina or wherever .
Says John Boehner , âIf Democrats seriously want to import known terrorists -- captured in the field of battle against American troops -- perhaps we can set them up with a nice sunny spot in San Francisco ?â 
Sunny spot ?
Has he ever been to San Francisco ?
How come the WaPo quoted only part of a pro-war banner held by counter-protesters in Washington , âYou dishonor our dead on Hallowed groundâ  ( meaning Arlington ) , and left out the words above that , visible in a picture in the LAT , âGo to hell traitorsâ  ?
The WaPo , in an unrevealing article about how McCain is joined at the hip with the Iraq war , quotes a stump speech in Iowa , in which he claims that the people fighting us in Iraq arenât really interested in Iraq per se : â I am convinced that if we lose this conflict and leave , [the terrorists ] will follow us home .
Itâs not Iraq they are trying to take .â 
Then why donât they just skip the Iraq segment of what McCain calls âthis titanic struggle between good and evilâ  and come here now ?
