What a useful little blender/chopper !
Much better than the old electric hand blender I used to own .
I had the kind with two "beaters " that would spin .
The mixer would often cause liquids to spray .
The cuisinart csb-33 hand mixer 's design prevents liquids from spraying and it 's very easy to clean .
Just a quick rinse under in some hot soapy water is all it needs .<p> I
would definitely recommend this for anyone .
