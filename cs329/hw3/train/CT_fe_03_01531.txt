And they 're running around screaming , " I do n't make enough money so I 'm not gonna play until you give me more " .
Yeah .
And they 'll always get more money 'cause it 's --
Right .
-- it 's --
' Cause they ca n't afford to not have them play .
Right , it 's a multi million dollar industry .
But -- right .
And , I think , education should be --
Number one .
Right .
I agree .
The- they 're trying to pass a lottery here in Oklahoma so that more money can go towards funding education and there are a lot people opposing it and , you know , I 'm one of those that will say , " Well , our taxpayers will just keep going to Texas or Kansas or Louisiana --"
Mhm .
-- or whatever to spend their money instead of putting it back into the state .
Mhm .
So , they 're trying to make it to where anything generated by the lottery will go directly to education .
Yeah .
I think that 'll help to a point .
Yeah , and I remember when lottery started that 's what it was meant for , like , the percentage of it was supposed to go towards education but I remember seeing , I do n't know if it 's still like that , but I know a lot people were n't -- a lot of people in the education field were n't even seeing that money even though it was supposedly made for that purpose .
Right .
But --
See that 's the one and only purpose they 're wanting it here --
Yeah .
-- and you figure , you know , the athletes they 've got a better shot at hitting the millions by joining up in college or high school or whatever --
Yeah .
-- hoping to get a pro career --
Right .
-- than any one person does hitting it in the lottery .
I agree .
I agree with you totally .
And unfortunately the United States do n't have a whole lot doing the soccer and that 's the biggest sport we have in this area of Oklahoma .
Yeah .
That 's soccer .
Soccer ?
Mhm .
Well , we 've got the Mavericks , we 've got the Cowboys , we 've got the Stars , we 've got , like , you know , a good amount of people but , you know , still I do n't hear anything extraordinary about these people that , you know , about the amounts of money they 're giving to charity or the amounts of money they 're giving towards education --
Mhm .
-- or anything .
Nope , not at all .
Yeah .
And I think it 's absolutely ridiculous .
I agree .
I think too it 's going to be real controversial .
Yeah .
The subject they 're putting out because they 're gonna find some big football players somewhere that 's just gonna go nuts and --
Yeah , and really sports is not a necessary -- you know , the sports industry , is not really a necessary industry , you know , like --
