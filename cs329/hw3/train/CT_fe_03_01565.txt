Yeah .
-- how many -- how many hundreds of thousands of dollars per game .
Ha .
So ...
Well , I do n't , uh -- I 'm not a big sports fan unless , of course , uh , the Broncos are actually doing something , or the Nuggets are doing something .
But , uh , this time around nah .
No, I know .
But , uh --
Broncos , I mean , they usually --
Now , the Av- --
-- they usually ...
Now , the Avalanches is a different story , you know --
Yeah .
-- it 's a -- they 're all right .
But , um --
Yeah .
-- you know , these other guys I do n't know .
They 've been go - yeah , they 've been good for a while .
Ha .
Yeah .
So , that 's always -- that 's always a good thing to watch .

Exactly .
And they say their job is dangerous !
Maybe -- I mean , maybe you play baseball , ha , you can get hit by a ball or something .
Right .
