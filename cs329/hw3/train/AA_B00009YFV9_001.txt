We purchased this floor mop to replace our H3000 that had gone bad .
Although we loved the H3000 , this mop is even better !
We have a lot of tile flooring so to make mopping easier on the back , we purchased these floor mops .
You 'll be amazed at the "mud " that the mop picks up off your floor .
The H2800 mop features a fixed bristle brush versus the rotating brushes of the H3000 .
The fixed brushes do a better job .
