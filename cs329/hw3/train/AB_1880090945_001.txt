The book , A Half Acre of Hell , expresses a view that is n't often seen .
The view is that of a World War II combat nurse .
It is written by Avis Schorer based on her first hand account of the war .
This book gives in great detail where a nurse traveled during the war and what places she got to see .
It is made interesting through the use of major historic events connected to where the author was at that time .
Also , the book is interesting because the reader gets to see many of the daily aspects of war , not just an overview .
This book would not be a good read for some one expecting a war book based around tactics or combat , although some are included .
It is more a journal of events .
The book is easy to follow and good for anyone interested in a nurse 's account of the war .
