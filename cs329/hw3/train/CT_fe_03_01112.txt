Yeah , I worked two and three jobs , had little piddly jobs while I was --
Who watched the kids ?
Um , my -- my parents watched the kids a little bit , ah , a - -- after they were in daycare during the day , so --
Mhm .
-- afterwards they would , ah , go home and then once they got in school , they would --
See , that 's my problem , I feel like if I do go out and work , by the time what I 'd get paid for three kids --
Yeah .
-- you know .
It 's not even worth it .
It 's not -- and -- and you got to buy -- you got to find decent daycare --
Right .
-- you ca n't just send them anywhere .
Right .
Yeah , so , I mean , I had my parents were -- and they were working , but you know , they c - -- they were home at a decent hour --
Mhm .
-- so that the kids could -- they could pick up the kids from the -- the --the -- the daycare --
Mhm .
-- and then they went on a - -- you know , and did whatever in the evening while I was still either at my job or at a class or whatever .
Mhm .
Usually was one or two of them .
I -- I -- I tell you , for the first three years I do n't think I hardly slept any , I -- I 'd say I amazed me now I 'm not on drugs .
Right .
Well , what did you go to college for ?
I went to college for finance --
Uh-huh .
-- and chemistry .
Uh-huh .
But I did n't end up doing that .
That 's what everybody says when they go to college they go for one thing and they do n't end up --
Yeah , I 'm going to tell you what you do ; you go to college for something you like to do .
If you 're a writer , you like to write , you go to do that .
Mhm .
Do n't go to do something practical that you ai n't going to like .
Yeah .
Trust me .
Because you end up in a job that you just ca n't stand and then one day you just snap and tell folks if they do n't get out your office --
-- you 're going to break their necks .
That 's true .
Yeah .
[inaudible ] because you just going to snap , I mean , there was plenty of time -- I t- -- one day , I was in a -- in this one office , it was a big office with the cubicles , I pulled a desk and a chair , it was actually a table and a chair --
Mhm .
-- and hooked up the phone line , pulled it right on out the wall and put myself in the closet because those folks was plucking my nerves --
