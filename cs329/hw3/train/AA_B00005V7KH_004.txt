This Food Processor Attachment came with the MUM7150 I purchased about a three months ago .
Although Bosch make many fine products , I am slightly disappointed with this one .<p>The
cutting/mixing blade works like it should and I have chopped everything from nuts to homemade guacamole without any problems .
I also like the fact that the bowl easily detaches from the handle and base to go straight to the dishwasher after use .
My disappointment with this unit stems around the 3 disks and plastic disk holder .
I have attempted to shred/grate parmesan cheese and as the other reviewer found , the cheese did gum up between the disk , plastic holder , and bowl .
I have also attempted to shred/grate chocolate .
This ended up becoming a melted mess as the blade did more to melt the chocolate than shred it .
<p>Overall , if you are getting this , I would recommend it for the cutting/mixing blade , but find a deep dark place in your cupboards to put the disks and holder .
If you are looking for a slicer/shredder for your Bosch MUM 7/MEK 7 Kitchen Machine , I would try the Bosch MUZ 7 TS1 Slicer/Shredder instead .
