Up here in the deep north it is essential to have humidifier if you have musical instruments , or anything made out of nice wood .
I have tried several different options , and evaporative humidifiers are the best .
This one has enough nice features to warrent an excellent rating .
The main great feature is that it is easy to add water to the system .
The tanks remove easily , and can be filled from the kitchen sink ( they are too tall for filling in a bathroom sink ) .
In the dead of winter expect to fill it daily , but fortunately this is big enough to only need filling once per day .
Other nice features include a fan speed control ( pump humidity in fast because you were gone all weekend and its dry ) , or quiet .
At low speed settings you barely know its on .
I also like the optional air cleaning evaporator .
It apparently slows down air flow , but that seems trivial since the fan can simply be turned up .
