Yeah , I know .
Um , yeah , and maybe it 's also , um , a question of just , ah , working things out sometimes and people , you know , decide that they do n't have the patience to do that any more .
Yeah , I think we 're kind of like a disposable society .
If you do n't like this thing , throw it away and get another one so --
And try on something else .
Yeah .
Yeah .
You know , people , are so quick to , ah , make a change .
Yes , yes , very much so .
It 's not a very -- it 's not a very pleasant circumstance but sometimes -- I mean , sometimes divorce is a better option than suffering and living in -- living with a lot of tension and some things just do n't work out and you have to get out of it .
Mhm , especially if there are children involved .
Yeah , then it gets messy and I guess it shakes their confidence for having relationships later .
I mean , they have the fear that it can always end in a break up if they have seen their parents go through the same thing .
Mhm .
Right .
But me , when I have n't had too many friends or relatives or people I know who have got divorced but , yeah , it is a really high end of -- I 've read somewhere that it 's likely even higher in Europe where they -- almost half the marriages end in divorces or something like that .
Oh .
Which is , like , really high .
I know -- I probably know more people whose parents never got married .
Okay .
In the first place so --
Okay .
Than , yeah , divorce never came up .
But still they did n't have , you know -- they did n't live in a two parent household .
Okay .
I mean , yeah , but the institution of marriage has less meaning nowadays as in , it 's okay to live unmarried and the -- the olden days that they were living in sin and things like that and that 's all okay nowadays so , I guess people are waiting longer to get married .
Yeah , I think they take it for granted .
Mhm .
Like what it really is supposed to be about .
Yes , mhm .
People should n't rush into it .
Mhm , yes , take their time and get to know the person .
Otherwise --
Mhm .
Um , it does n't seem like -- I do n't think that so many people , like , as far as , like , this new generation of children who are , like , have divorced parents are going to be , like , any worse off than --
Okay .
Other kids and --
Okay .
Most of the time in two parent families but their -- their lifestyle would be a little different .
Mhm .
But , you know , most of the time , they 're just --
Yeah .
Might I say even make them a little more independent not having people to look after them .
