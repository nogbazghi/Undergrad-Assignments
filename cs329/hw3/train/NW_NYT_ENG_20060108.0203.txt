West Virginians began burying their fallen miners
on Sunday , mourning their losses but celebrating the lives and
legacies of men who prided themselves on making a living
by harvesting coal from deep within the earth .
In the mountain hamlets surrounding the Sago Mine , hundreds of mourners
turned out for the funerals of six of the 12
men killed there last week .
But the grief , sympathy and
prayers extended well beyond the funerals , most of them private
services from which reporters were banned .
White ribbons and bows adorned utility poles in Buckhannon , and dozens
of roadside signs conveyed the somber mood .
" Healing hurts , " said
one sign outside a doughnut shop here .
One just north
of town read , " God just got 12 new angels . "
At the service for Jesse L.
Jones , a 44-year-old miner from
Pickens , the Rev. Donald Butcher , pastor of Sand Run Baptist
Church , spoke the names of each of the 12 men
killed at the mine and talked about their way of
making a living and making a life .
" God gives us people who are heroes , and we do n't even
realize it , " he said .
" We got lots of coal miners
here with us today .
America is great because of this
profession and because of men like Jesse , who put their
lives on the line . "
The other miners buried Sunday were Alva Martin Bennett , 51 ; Jerry
Groves , 56 ; David Lewis , 28 ; Martin Toler , 51 ; and Jack
Weaver , 52 .
Even as the towns mourned their dead , people kept praying for
the recovery of the sole survivor of the mine disaster ,
Randal McCloy Jr. , 26 .
Doctors at West Virginia University Hospitals ,
where McCloy is being treated , said that he remained in
critical condition Sunday night but that his heart , lung and
muscle functions had improved .
McCloy was breathing on his own , and doctors had stopped sedating
him .
