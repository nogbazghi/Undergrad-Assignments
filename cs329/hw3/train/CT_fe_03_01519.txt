Right .
I hope that does n't happen here .
But ...
Yeah .
Now , have -- ah , how is your football team there ?
Do they have very high salaries ?
I guess I do n't know a lot about them .
I mean , like , the Cowboys are like the highest grossing team in the United States right now .
Oh , my gosh , wow .
There 's just -- they 're supposed to get like a hundred and seventy five million , I think , a season .
Oh , my goodness .
On revenues , that 's crazy .
Wow , wow , that 's a lot .
Well , we 're going through the -- they want a new stadium here , both the football and , and the Twins .
Oh , that 's cool .
But -- and now , you know with the war and the economy , we do n't hear so much about it anymore , so --
Right , yeah .
Maybe they 're gonna put it on the back burner , but people just ca n't seem to afford that either , we 're paying the players so much money , and --
Right .
-- nobody wants their taxes to go up .
Right .
So , well at least you and I both agree .
Yeah .
I do n't know if that 's good or not , or if it 's better to have somebody to debate -- debate with .
Yeah , yeah .
I mean , I do n't know what the other side of the topic could be , because , you know --
Well , I do n't , I do n't either .
I mean , if -- you know , unless you 're one of the , one of the players .
Yeah .
' Cause , I , I would imagine the owners are n't very happy when they go on strike either , to -- you know --
Right .
-- to talk about it or threaten it .
It 's -- it does n't do them any good either , they 're trying to make money , I 'm sure .
Yeah .
We have a Texan that owns our Vikings here , McCombs .
Yeah .
So , I do n't know if he 's gonna keep them here or not , but when they argue about they pay , sometimes I think people just say , well , go some place else , and -- you know .
Yeah .
If that 's the way you feel .
But they just ca n't seem to be satisfied for some reason or other .
Yeah .
It just comes down to greed .
Yeah , I think you 're right .
I think that 's true .
Although some of them , I guess -- I , I , I guess some do a lot for different charities and so forth .
But --
Right .
-- maybe we do n't always hear about that .
Yeah .
And I 'm sure when there 's a strike , there 's some of them that do n't -- do n't want to strike .
Yeah , they just wanna play .
Yep.
So , those are the ones I feel bad for .
Look , we watch , we watch a lot of sports , so we feel bad when they are n't on .
