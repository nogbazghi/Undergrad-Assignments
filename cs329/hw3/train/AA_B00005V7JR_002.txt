This is an awesome meatgrinder .
I just aquired the Bosch Compact machine and this attachment .
I'am really happy with it .
It makes the best burgers and you know what kind of meat is in them .
<br> I also tried it on some vegetables and does them also nicely .
If you own the Bosch Compact and like grinding your own meat , this is a great buy .
