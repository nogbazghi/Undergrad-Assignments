Yes , these are cheap bags .
That 's a good thing .
You can boil them , you can microwave them and you can store things in them , for about the same price as brand-name zipper bags .
But you need the Deni Freshlock Vac Sealer -1331 or similar thing to make them work .
They are indeed open on three sides .
As the Deni seals lightning-quick , it 's no slower than the single seal you have to make with higher end roll bags , and there 's a reason for it .
You pull out just a bit of bag and make a seal .
Then you start pulling out more , measuring against the item you want to bag .
You unfold the plastic , place the item on a clean , foodsafe surface , and make another seal and cut .
Now you have a pouch and your food is in the pouch , struggle and hassle free .
With some sorts of immersion cooking , you do not actually WANT a sealed bag .
If so , you are done .
Then you make one or more seals as closely as possible to the food to minimize air retention while vacuuming .
It 's very quick , and definitely good enough to protect food from freezer burn for several weeks .
Not for several months or years , but several weeks .
It 's just fine for protecting dry items for long-term storage , as long as the bag itself can be protected .
