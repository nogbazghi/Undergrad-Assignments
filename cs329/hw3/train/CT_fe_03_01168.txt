Yes , had we gone there and would we have stayed or would we have come back home , or what would we have done ?
Mhm .
You know , there was about four of us that were going to go .
Yeah .
That did n't work out .
Is n't it sad [several inaudible words ] going , " No , I really wish I would have done this " --
Or --
You know ?
-- or , or what if ?
You know ?
What --
Yeah .
-- if I would have turned that corner instead of this corner .
Yeah , and --
You know ?
-- everything would be different .
Uh-huh .
' Cause you can trace everything back , like , you met a certain person because you went to , you know , this event .
And you only went to that event because you met this other person and , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah .
Yeah .
And it all goes back and the smallest little thing could change everything .
That 's true --
[inaudible ] --
-- what do they say ?
Life turns on a dime .
Yeah .
Mhm , mhm .
It 's kind of creepy .
It really is --
-- when you think about it .
It really is --
Yeah .
--
Let 's see , what else would I change ?
I know .
I would have been nicer to my mother .
Actually , both my parents .
I was a brat when I was a teenager , and I think everyone is .
Absolutely .
But , it was awful when I saw my little sister going through it --
Uh-huh .
-- and , 'cause you know you go through that phase where you love your parents , and then you hate your parents , and then when you 're older you love them again .
Yeah .
So , I was back into , like , loving my parents and I was watching my sister be , you know , the little devil and hate them .
And --
-- it was awful 'cause , ah , she was exactly like me in every way and what an awful person I had been for , like , years .
It was really depressing , and I feel really guilty .
But , I do n't really know how to tell my parents [inaudible ] " Sorry for being a brat .
--"
Just --
Did n't mean to" .
-- just tell 'em .
Yeah .
Sometimes it 's just easier that way --
Mhm .
-- just to blurt it out and tell them .
Exactly .
Mm .
What else would I change ?
Mm .
I would like to have gone places --
Traveled ?
-- and traveled .
Hi Kitty .
' Cause I 've never been anywhere .
Well , like , you 're still -- it sounds like you 're still young enough that you can go do that .
Yeah .
Just need some money .
But , now it 's so scary going anywhere because now , apparently , we 're in , like , the war .
