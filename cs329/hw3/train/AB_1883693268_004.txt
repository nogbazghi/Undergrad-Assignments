To put it simply , I ordered this book on a whim , recommended from a fellow marine aquarist , and since then I have n't been able to put it down .
I have never seen a more comprehensive and affordable review of Saltwater Angelfish , including many images of extremely rare species and hybrids .
The images of Angelfish Aquariums maintained by aquarists in Asia is a unique section that really makes you think about how we keep our own aquariums .
The only section I found lacking was the section which covered the current captive rearing of marine angelfish - I believe the author could have done more in-depth research , especially into the farm-raised Pomacanthus currently being produced in Asia .
