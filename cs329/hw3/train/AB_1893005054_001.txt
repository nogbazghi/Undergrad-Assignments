I have read quite a few books on weight loss and this one is the best so far .
It has good advice .
Tells you that you can basically eat what you want as long as you eat healthy , make good choices , exercise and cut back on your portion sizes .
It also advises not to say that you are on a diet but that you are opting to eat healthy .
It also recommends that you eat foods high in fiber and water content .
That way you can eat more with less calories .
All of these suggestions I have heard before but I find this book informational .
It is an easy read .
Anyway I do recommend this book .
