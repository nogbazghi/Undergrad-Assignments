I felt that this book was very simplistic in its explanations and its exercises .
That 's not to say that sometimes the simple exercises are n't the hardest , but rather I could 've and really have thought of these things before .
It also was completely centered on the male experience of sex addiction .
All of the case stories were about men and most of the examples of behaviors/thinking were very male oriented ( ex .
going to strip clubs , hiring prostitutes , thinking that women want to be dominated ) and completely ignored the particular way that women experience sex addiction .
Resources that I 've found to be more powerful and insightful : the basic text for SLAA ( Sex & Love Addicts Anonymous ) and " Women , Sex , & Addiction " by Charlotte Kasl .
This last text is the only one I 've ever seen that adequately deals with the female experience .
