I requested an EL012W washable filter for the Electrolux Oxygen3 vacumm cleaner .
So far , I 've been sent the EL013W which does n't fit the Oxygen3 and the EL012 which is not the washable version .
My initial e-mail was promptly followed by the vendor sending me the EL012 ( non-washable filter ) , but they have not responded to my latest e-mail telling them the order was still wrong now over a month later .
