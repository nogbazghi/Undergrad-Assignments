I really enjoyed this book .
I am an AS/400 programmer with 11 years experience and want to become more familiar with Windows programming .
I started off with a Sam 's Teach Yourself Visual C++ in 21 days ( which I also liked ) and followed up with this one .
The authors presented the material in an easy to read and follow format .
I only had two issues with the book .
One , the authors would occasionally pull a function out of nowhere and use it with little or no explanation as to why .
And two , I thought they dragged out the examples on drawing too long .
I would have preferred more time spent on the database chapter rather than the drawing examples .
But , overall an excellent book and I highly recommend it .
