I enjoyed this book myself , then one of our guest writers at our online magazine , [ ...] , Gail Katz , wrote her own recommendation of Rabbi Kula 's book .
Gail points out that , as a Jewish woman , this book touched her -- but I can also recommend this to a broader audience , as well .
The entire concept of the book is fresh and appealing because -- let 's be honest -- most of us do not lead perfectly organized lives .
Our lives are not only messy -- they 're filled with ambiguity and daily friction .
We love our family , for example , but we question -- and sometimes deeply disagree -- with some family members .
The messiness extends further into our workplaces , communities and world .
Rabbi Kula is trying to provide a spiritual framework for accepting that messiness as part of life 's pilgrimage .
Rather than trying to escape it , he argues , we should realize that a certain messiness is the fabric of life itself .
The challenge is where we will allow our yearnings to carry us in this pilgrimage through the mess .
