Having worked in the medical field for 25 years I thought I knew everything about nutrition , but this book is fabulous .
The beginning is an easy to follow explanation of how the carbs we love so much cause our blood sugar to spike ; how adding fiber (veggies and fruits ) to carbs can help lower their impact on our blood sugar ; how eating more veggies along with protein , fruit , and carbs ( in that order ) can supply us with a great source of energy and fuel for the day , without a constant feeling of hunger ( which spikes in blood sugar cause ) .
I lost 15 pounds the first month I followed this eating plan .
Yeah , yeah , it helps to add exercise , of course ...but exercise is easier to do when you have the energy to face it ! ! !
