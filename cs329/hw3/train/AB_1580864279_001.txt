This book is wonderful .
I purchased it for my 6 year old and he loves to read it .
Even my 3 year old loves it .
They ask to read it each night before bed .
It presents a lot of information , but it is also a great discussion starter book .
We read some things and then talk about the subject even more .
It also helps the kids to come up with their own questions on whatever subject we are reading .
THe internet links are great also .
This is a very all encompassing book that hits many of the highlights of Our World .
I would recommend this book to any child interested in learning more about the world in which we live .
