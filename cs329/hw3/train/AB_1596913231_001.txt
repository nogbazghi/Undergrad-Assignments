I was indulging Parisian fantasies and feeling quite historical as I tripped along through the opening pages of Mr. Hussey 's " Paris : The Secret History " when I encountered the section on page 49 entitled , " Vermin . "
Led to believe by the book 's preceding subtitles ( " Sea Gods , " " Infidels " ) that the section 's subject would be about rats and how Paris rid itself of them , I worked my way through its one-and-a-half pages only to find there was not one mention of rats , but many about the presence of Jews in Paris .
Bending far back to be fair , the section did talk about the mistreatment of Jews by other Parisians , appearing to report the facts of centuries of discrimination and abuse without passing any judgement .
Having finished the section in a puzzled state , however , I double-checked the subtitle again .
Yes , it was " Vermin . "
My querulousness turned to palpable shock as I realized I has just witnessed--just innocently browsed through--the starkest example of anti-semitism as I have ever seen in my reading life--and here it was , in a passably written book authored by someone who appeared to be scholarly and who had been published by a seemingly reputable firm and was now being sold by an upstanding American firm .
Vermin ?
VERMIN ?
Rats live everywhere and will never be eradicated , but have only a metaphorical connection to Judiasm in the minds of a precious but pernicious few , and--as it somehow happens , incredibly--in pages 49-51 of this dispicable tome , the heart of its questionable author , and the slippery-sloped bottomline of the publisher and booksellers anywhere who blithly peddle their wares regardless of its moral content .
I gave this book one " star"--forced to in order to post this comment and feeling slimed in the process .
