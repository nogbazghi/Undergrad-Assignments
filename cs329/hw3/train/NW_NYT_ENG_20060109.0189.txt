Cox News Service WEST PALM BEACH , Fla . -- Magnesium consumption through
diet and supplements is positively associated with bone density throughout
the whole body , particularly in older white adults , according to
research published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society .
Researchers say the effects are similar to that of calcium .
old were asked to complete a questionnaire to determine how much
magnesium they were receiving from food and various supplements .
Additionally ,
researchers performed bone mineral density tests on the participants .
The study revealed those who ingested more magnesium had significantly higher
bone density than those who got the least amount of
magnesium .
For every 100 milligram per day increase in magnesium
intake , data showed a 1 percent increase in bone density .
However , this link was only true for the older white men
and women .
Previous research has demonstrated that black men and
women may process vitamin D differently from whites .
The recommended daily allowance of magnesium is 320 mg/day for women
and 420/mg day for men in this age group .
Most
people in this age group get far less than this
daily amount .
Plaque-protein link
Researchers at Washington University in St . Louis and the University of
Pittsburgh combined high-tech brain imaging with measurement of beta-amyloid protein
fragments in cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) .
They found that greater amounts
of beta-amyloid-containing plaques in the brain were associated with lower
levels of a specific protein fragment central to Alzheimer 's disease
development .
