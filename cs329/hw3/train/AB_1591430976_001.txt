BEYOND 2012... is a virtual Ph.D. dissertation on just about every subject related to 2012 .
Although Geoff Stray has written this book in layman 's language , with plenty of illustrations and color plates for entertaining and informative reading , this is nevertheless a very scholarly work with great attention to detail and an impressive dedication to "getting things right " .
Quite simply , this is THE most comprehensive book on the subject of 2012 I have read so far .
And the least agenda-based or theory-driven , so readers have more freedom to draw their own conclusions .
Impressive in both its scope and depth , it not only covers familiar ground , but does so with fresh insights , and also reaches out to more distant vistas , to the "event horizon " surrounding 2012 , and the predicted changes within its influence .
This is a beautiful book and though softbound I would say that no expense has been spared in its production .
It 's also a BIG book , almost 300 pages and is well worth the modest price , considering it represents 25 years of research .
This book belongs in any serious ( non-strictly empirical ) thinker 's library .
