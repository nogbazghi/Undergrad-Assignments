First off , do not think that this will give you an in-depth look at the combat situations these groups entered into .
A great deal is only touched upon , i .e . " they encountered strong resistance , then the enemy fled " , but the actions of valor that these men did individually is given considerable attention .
What this book is mainly focusing on is the "military necessity " that created a sort of legal racism that was not held across the board .
The fact that these men did what they did despite how their very own country treated them is inspiring at the very least .
But I do feel that this book can mirror current events as well .
Granted , I hope we have learned that lesson , but we can still look at this example when we deal with other nations who are predominately non-white and assume that " they " are all the same , for indeed they are not .
