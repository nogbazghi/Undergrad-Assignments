I 've been cooking and baking for 50 years and gone through a lot of whisks in that time .
My son bought me this 12-inch balloon whip for my birthday , and it 's put the fun back into preparing foods .
I 'm whipping out fluffier eggs , creamier creams and smoother sauces in half the time and with half the effort of any other whisk I 've had .
