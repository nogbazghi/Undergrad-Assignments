I thought Robin Hood by Howard Pyle was a good book because it showed how smart Robin is .
It showed this by how many times he tricked the sheriff .
This book show also how nice Robin Hood really was .
He would steal from the rich and give to the poor who were always asked for taxes by the sheriff .
