Itâs been a mixed day .
I had some not very good pizza , but on the other hand there were ducks ( live ducks , not as a pizza topping ) , I caught Trader Joeâs trying to overcharge me 20Â¢ on butter and they did nât have my preferred brand of cheddar cheese , so I bought some New Zealand grass fed cheddar , which I donât like at all , but on other hand there were ducks .
So with all the ducks and whatnot , Iâm a little behind on blogging .
Dan Bartlett , yesterday : âSo the President has all the confidence in the world in Alberto Gonzalesâ .
Thatâs all the confidence .
In the entire world .
Man , leave some for the rest of us .
Bush , in Mexico : â We are a rule of law .â 
Whatever .
Gen . Petraeus dragged Maliki to Ramadi yesterday to show that he was nât afraid of going to mostly Sunni Anbar province .
Maliki went , but he would nât set foot outside a US military base .
Petraeus was braver ( and heavily guarded ) .
Last sentence of the WaPo article : âAs he headed back to the convoy , he stopped at a house , spoke a few words in Arabic and , looking at his soldiers , told the family : âMeet your new neighbor .ââ 
And then , I assume , he urinated on their front stoop , just to drive the point home .
Bush and Calderon in Mexico yesterday at some Mayan pyramids .
Mayan pyramids with Secret Service sharpshooters .
