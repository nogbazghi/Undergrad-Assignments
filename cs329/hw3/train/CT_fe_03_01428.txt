Mhm .
And I think , you know , ever since that incident , probably more than ever , it - it 's always whenever we do something or just regular events in general , I think you appreciate it more and you think about it more , take things on the lighter side , um --
Mhm .
-- yeah , it 's -- it 's a little bit different attitude , I think .
I 've also been in contact with some people that I probably would not be in contact with --
Right .
Oh , I bet .
-- if it had n't of happened .
I got -- I got email from people I went to college with saying , " Are you okay ? "
Oh , wow ! That 's great .
So , um , I 'm more likely to touch base with people and --
Sure .
-- and you know , keep track of them and let them know what I 'm up to .
Yeah .
Yeah .
It brings back more , uh , that -- that -- that human warmth , I suppose , where , wow , you think about somebody and it 's like , you know , let 's just give a call .
Let 's just , you know --
Mhm .
Yeah , that 's it .
I 've definitely been doing that more .
Yeah .
Yeah .
And , where in the past , maybe we were just so busy with your -- our everyday life , it 's -- you know , for a while there , you just seem to let things go , you know ?
Yeah .
Just run , run here , there , just do everything , just the fast track is always overcoming , you know ?
Mhm .
But , um , but yeah , I -- I would say ever since that incident .
And now with the war , too , it 's -- I have a nephew that 's , um , over in Iraq right now and he 's on our mind constantly .
Mm .
You know ?
And so anything we d- do around here that 's family event related , you know , you just start thinking of where he is and why he 's there and , uh , it just gets you thinking that , uh , you know , as a whole , where government and the world is concerned , it 's , um , it 's an interesting , uh , huh , you know , time of our lives right now , I guess .
Mhm .
Just nev- never know what to , uh , to think and you 're always kinda like watching your back sometimes .
Yeah .
We 're definitely more wary of what 's going on , I think .
Mhm .
Yeah .
Yeah .
Do you have , uh , young kids ?
Any kids ?
I have one son .
He 's six years old .
Oh , okay .
Yeah .
Yeah .
And I bet he 's a big concern of yours , of course ?
Yeah .
Whatever he does , wherever he goes ?
Do you feel like yourself , more than ever , you 're keeping tabs on him a little --
I -- I think I 've always been cautious about that sort of thing , so I do n't think there 's anything that I 'm doing --
