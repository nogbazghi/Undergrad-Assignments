I really enjoyed this 2nd helping of chicken soup .
Every story reaches out to you and you can relate closely to so many .
In fact , one story in particular was very , very touching .
It made both my husband and me cry .
It was a story about a dog that meant alot to a woman and her experiences with that dog and then the sad end to the dog 's life .
Well , it just so happened that I read that story to my husband on the eve of our one year anniversary of losing our family dog of thirteen years .
It was so like our experience that it sent a shiver down your spine and finally we both cried .
It was as if our dog was saying hi to us in his own way , that we had n't forgotten him .
Anyways , I love all the stories in your books .
I 've read Chicken Soup and now a 2nd helping .
So , now I am reading Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover 's Soul .
I ca n't wait to read them all ! ! Thank you soooooo much for these wonderful books to read .
