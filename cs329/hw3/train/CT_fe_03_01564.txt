-- you know -- yeah .
Right .
So , that they , like , uh , uh , or probably they should , you know , uh , divide the athletes according to the , uh , level of the commitment , or like how much , uh , time they can dedicate towards this one .
Right .
And how -- how much they are coping out with , uh , uh , uh , present day competition and then they can -- they should fix their contract or something and , oh , probably the contract should be given something like a -- a per year basis and then keep on extending it later on .
Yeah , that sounds like --
Based on their performance .
Right .
Probably that way it -- it 'll be kind of fair among both the sides , you know ?
Exactly .
I agree .
I -- I definitely agree .
Um ...
Yeah .
But -- yeah , but see , like -- seeing the way they -- they bring up their country and aware of what they represent , uh , in what was this process --
Right .
-- not , oh -- i- i- it 's kind of fair to , like , you know , oh , provide some kind of , uh , other facilities to them also , like probably giving some [inaudible ] for their education and also other kind of , uh , things .
Right .
Um , are -- are you a follower of sports ?
Do you follow much , uh , sports now ?
Yeah , I do .
Even , uh -- I do play quite a few games but , uh -- yeah , well , uh , usually I do n't get much time but whenever I do get time I do , uh , keep -- follow the , uh , sports and all .
Uh , that 's one reason -- like , you know , what makes me , uh , feel that , you know , uh , justice to be done to whatever the amount of effort and the work they do put in , like , you know , they 're allowed to get up or they ca n't miss the practices every now and then .
Right .
It 's dedication .
Lots of [inaudible ] and their diet and then the body work , everything .
Right .
Uh , they should be , like , you know -- if -- if they -- if they come out of it for a few days , take a break from it for a few days , they wo n't be , uh , really able to get back into it actually .
Exactly .
Uh , and throughout the year they need to keep working on un- -- or I would say , like , probably thirty five years is the last , after that they wo n't be able to really work on it .
Right .
But , uh , uh , after that , uh , at least if they can have some amount of money as a security for them for their , uh , l- la - later part of life --
Right .
-- uh , that should probably , like , you know , uh , motivate , uh , them in a better way to go out and , like , you know --
