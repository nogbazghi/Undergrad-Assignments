I just recently picked this book up at the library and seeing that it won the Man Booker Prize , I thought it would be a worthwhile read .
I thought wrong - the book was frustrating and the characters seemed like cardboard cut-outs .
It was n't the steady stream of profanity that put me off , for what other language is to be expected from characters like Vernon , a 15-year-old rebellious teenager ?
It was just that the writing seemed to plod on and on and I could n't sympathize with any of the characters .
I wonder if I 'm in the minority , that I simply did n't get it ?
Oh well , there 's no accounting for literary taste , I guess .
Two other highly lauded books that I found torturous to finish were Arundhati Roy 's " The God of Small Things " , and Kiran Desai 's " The Inheritance of Loss . "
As for " Vernon God Little" , all I could say when I reached the end was a prayer that it had finally ended !
