Q . What time of year are most babies born in America ?
Why ?
A.
July and August recently traded first and second places among
the most common birth months , according to the National Center
for Health Statistics .
But statisticians would probably caution against finding
a strong trend , because the variation between months is not
wide and because links between seasonal timing and possible causes
are not clear .
In 2002 , there were about 359,000 births in August and 358,000
in July .
In 2003 , there were 364,226 births in July
and 360,103 in August .
The totals for the rest of
the months of 2003 varied only moderately , from 307,248 in
February , with just 28 days , to 359,644 in September .
The
Center for Health Statistics noted that all the months showed
narrowly distributed average birthrates , from 14.5 to 14.7 live births
per 1,000 women from 15 to 44
A much stronger trend can be found for days of the
week : Sundays averaged just 7,563 births in 2003 ; Mondays climbed
to 11,733 ; Tuesdays surged to 13,001 ; Wednesdays , 12,598 ; Thursdays , 12,514 ;
Fridays , 12,396 ; and Saturdays fell back to 8,605 .
A strong argument can be made for a preference for weekday
births in a modern health care system , with the possibility
of inducing labor ahead of weekends and holidays .
However , in an industrialized society , as opposed to an agrarian one ,
the season of the year is not an important factor
in the timing of childbirth or conception .
