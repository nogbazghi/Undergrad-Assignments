I just started reading " Cinematic Storytelling " and already I 've learned a lot ( this despite having spent a year at AFI , reading just about every classic filmmaking book out there , and having already directed two features and starting a third ) .
If you 're thinking of going to film school , or making a film , read this book .
It might be all you need .
