I does exactly what it is advertised to do and does it very well .
Two speed motor is a nice option and I frequently utilize it .
Well balanced and not too heavy even for us ladies .
Pretty quiet also .
I previously owned the Toro PowerSweep which I was very pleased with until I accidentally drove over it with my car .
After doing some research I decided on this model which offered quite a bit more power ( higher amperage motor ) for the same price .
After free shipping and a special thirty percent discount on Amazon for this particular item I wound up paying about the same as I did with the PowerSweep and that was two years ago .
I have not yet tried the vacuum option and proably wo n't as I have a landscaper perform my fall cleanup , so I cannot comment on it 's performance .
Overall you ca n't go wrong , I 'd buy it again ! ! !
By the way if I 'm not mistaken , this unit has been discontinued and superceeded by Toro part number 51574 which is basically the same unit save for a few changes with only a wee bit more power .
Hope this was helpful .
Go Amazon ! ! !
