To get here , yeah , I know .
It 's sad , it 's --
Hopefully it wo n't happen again .
Right , well , hopefully they 're kinda taking care of some of that over there now .
I do n't know .
Yeah .
It 's sad there too , you know .
Yeah .
Especially with Syria now .
Yeah , probably be the same thing there , is n't it ?
Yeah .
Yeah , it 's -- you 'd think they 'd kind of figure it out eventually that we -- well , we 've never went over and actually proved to 'em that we were n't gonna take that kind of stuff , I guess , so --
Right .
Now , I -- I 'm thinking that , uh , people over there are , uh , understanding that we -- we wo n't put up with it , I guess , I do n't know .
Right .
Yeah , but , uh --
Now , we got , uh , the SARS epidemic , um , --
Mhm .
Not only terrorists , we got , uh , -- and security reasons , we g- -- now we got SARS.
Yeah , that 's kind of a scary thing too --
-- you know , you never know if that 's some kind of a --
-- government test gone wrong over there of if it 's really a virus or what .
Yeah , I do n't even know how to , uh , deal with it .
Yeah , I 'm not sure , pretty scary though .
So , I guess that 's kinda like a terrorist thing too if they got on a plane and come over here and infected everybody .
That 's true because --
-- it must be -- I was reading yesterday that they had , uh , they just , uh , were talking about three hundred more cases --
-- than what they had admitted to before --
-- so , it must be just running rampant over there in , uh , China and Hong Kong .
Yeah .
But , yeah , I do n't know , it 's --
I do n't really know too much about that .
I do n't know w- how it affects ya , um --
I do n't know .
I do n't think they 've really come down with --
-- exactly w- where it 's from yet , but --
Huh , .
-- so , amazing , but , uh --
I do n't know .
It 's a crazy world --
So , you do these surveys at all much ?
It 's the first one I 've ever done like this .
This is my second one .
Is that right ?
Yesterday was , um -- our topic was , uh , um , baseball --
Oh ! .
-- strike , and I do n't know anything about baseball .
No ?
I love baseball .
I do a lot of baseball with my -- my youngest boy .
We -- a lot of coaching and stuff with the kids .
Oh , that 's good .
Pretty interesting .
So , these are kind of all different topics ?
Yeah , I think so .
Yeah , weird .
