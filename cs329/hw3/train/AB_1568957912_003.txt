I thought this book had some useful information when I first read it several years ago .
After I read it , I stopped taking selenium supplements and decreased my daily dosage of vitamin C to 2,000 mg .
Then I got a tumor in my neck ( spring 2000 ) , and most recently a breast tumor .
I read that selenium actually inhbits the growth of tumors , so I am upset for having followed Roizen 's advice .
Also , I learned that one can take up to 10 GRAMS of vitamin C per day with very beneficial results .
This vitamin also helps prevent and fight cancer .
Finally , Roizen completely omits any mention of the need for regular detoxification .
He says it 's okay to drink tap water !
I have lost my respect for this author and am now selling his book .
It 's out of date .
