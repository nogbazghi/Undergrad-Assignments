I have had this wonderful cordless vacuum for over a month and I do n't know how I ever vacuumed before .Such ease to use( after a few time useing )
No cords to plug and unplug.Can go from room to room now without the nasty cord having to be taken from room to room .Or no more cords to get wrapped around my feet or leg .
The power is great.Like it commits it last 30 minutes .For me that is the entire house .
Use of the attachment are easy to use .Pull them off the holders and slide onto the hose and off you go. But like it states this does use a lot of the battery charge .
The only thing that is hard to deal with is the hose .Once you are done with it and you put it back into the handle it does n't stay there .It takes some time to get the handle and hose attachment to make contact and stay .
The batteries are plan and simple Click the button and battery stays in place and click it again and out comes the battery so you can slide it into the charger .
Ease to dump canister.Though hard at first to get it to click back into place . But with use it becomes easier .
