I do n't have any Kitchen Aid appliances that are n't great !
The stand mixer makes everything easy .
Bread making is so much easier and big batches of cookies are a breeze .
The fact that a donation was made to the Susan Komen Foundation was a great bonus ( although it 's not automatic - you have to check your paperwork ) .
This was a gift for my daughter because she could n't live without one after using mine !
