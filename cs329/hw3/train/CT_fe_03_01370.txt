"-- and really trying to ex - experience some of the things that go on .
Not just only in our culture but in all cultures " .
Oh , yes .
You know ?
I -- I heartily agree and I think that was one of the best things , uh , with a catholic education , the books that you read exposed you to that --
That 's right .
And then you talked about it .
That 's right .
And that -- that 's part of -- of -- that 's the biggest part of any education system , is to teach and to -- to get that point across and they do n't do this .
I mean
Yeah .
Yeah , I agree .
It 's horrendous .
Yeah , my girlfriend is a school teacher and every -- she -- she retired but she went back --
Mhm .
And every year she 's gonna retire again .
Yeah .
And , you know , and it 's -- it 's happened a lot .
She -- she teaches history .
Mhm .
And , um , which she loves .
And , um , she also teaches , um , um , well , I guess it 's called government -- I do n't -- we used to call it civics .
Oh p - yeah , oh , P.O.D.
Yeah .
Yeah , problems of democracy , right .
Right .
Yeah .
And -- and -- and -- and to try to get them to understand , uh , um , you know , uh , government and history and to have an appreciation of --
Of what we have in this country , right .
Right .
Right .
And then they -- then there would n't be all these people saying , " Well , we should n't be in this war that we 're in" .
Right , right .
Because most of 'em , they have no clue what they 're fighting for , they do n't understand how oppressed these people have been , because they do n't -- they have n't read .
Right , right .
That 's right .
You know .
That --
They only hear the bad stuff , they do n't hear about the good people of -- that are -- that are in a situation .
I mean , today they were talking about some of the looting .
Yeah , they 're looting food for the most part .
Right .
Out of this one warehouse .
I mean but there again , history repeats itself and if --
Mhm .
-- they read and they -- and they would read the classics
Right .
That 's right .
There is so much --
And understand .
That 's right .
I -- I agree with you , because my girlfriend always would say , you know , " If you study history --"
Yeah .
"-- not just our students but our elected officials and everyone else " .
Right .
" If you study history , find out what , you know , some of the problems that other societies have had .
You can -- you can try to improve your society " .
