Carlos Alvarez , formerly a psych professor at Florida International University , was sentenced to 5 years for âconspiracy to become an unregistered foreign agentâ  for Cuba .
Not even becoming one , which would have doubled the sentence , just conspiracy to become one .
He passed to the Cuban government various pieces of unclassified information and personal information on Cuban exile leaders .
Iâm not sure how this constitutes a crime ( the prosecutor was allowed to say that the damage Alvarez may have done is unclear because we donât know what else he told Havana , which was an attempt to get the court to convict for uncharged crimes for which there was no evidence ) .
But of course the trial was held in Miami , so Alvarez , and his wife , who was sentenced to 3 years merely for knowing what her husband was doing and not calling the FBI , were really tried and convicted for political crimes .
The judge said their actions âundermined U.S. foreign policy .â 
So ?
He said they were âin a sense leading a double life , â  and that they had committed a âdeceit and betrayalâ  of the Cuban exile community .
Which may not be very nice , but ... so ?
Evidently US courts of law , at least in Florida , are now policing deceit and betrayal of the Cuban exile community .
