Uh-huh .

Oh wow !
So --
But on a regular basis you have eleven dogs and then --
Right .
-- whatever extra then -- how do you keep up with them ?
Well , they 're my babies .
They do n't stay in a kennel , they stay in the house or out in the backyard in a fenced area .
But they all sleep in the house at night .
And they 're yapping away .
Yeah .
They 're driving me crazy 'cause I 've just came in and they 're mad .
Oh , my god .
' Cause it 's nine o'clock over here .
Mm .
That 's so crazy .
So , I guess it 's six o'clock over there , right ?
Uh-huh .
That 's what everybody always says .
I know .
It 's nice and sunny .
Where -- where abouts in California ?
LA .
Huh ?

No kidding !
Do you ever see any movie stars and stuff ?
Yeah , a lot .
Oh , golly !
Well , I live close to where they film Dawson 's Creek but that 's about it .
What ?
Yeah , Wilmington , North Carolina .
Oh , okay , yeah I know where that is ? Well --
But I 'm -- I 'm out at high point so they have , um , oh crap , the international home furnishing , it 's the worldwide home furnishing market now .
Oh .
They come from all over the United States and --
Uh-huh .
-- all over Europe and everything for our furniture market .
Oh wow !
So --
So , is it more like wood furniture ?
Yeah , mhm .
Okay .
But it 's crap .
Like more --
Most of it 's made in China and shipped over here and assembled .
Oh , I see .
Yeah , so it stinks but --
It 's not like the -- so it 's not like high end expensive ?
Oh , yeah .
It 's high end and expensive .
Is it ?
It 's the most expensive furniture you can buy like Boyhill , Thomasfield , um , Bassett .
Really ?
Yeah , but all that furniture 's made in China now .
Mm .
And it 's assembled over here in our factory .
Oh , okay .
They rip everybody off .
I know , for the amount of money that they --
Yeah .
-- paid for it .
Huh ?
W- -- especially for the amount of money they probably paid for the labor --
Oh , yeah .
They 're closing our factory .
So --
Mm , well they still have to keep the factory to have it assembled here .
Yeah .
But just [inaudible] , you know , since they do n't make it here any more .
Uh-huh , uh-huh .
But that 's cool .
I wonder if we 're paying for this .
I do n't know .
We better not be paying for this .
You -- you did n't -- no , it would n't because you did n't call out .
