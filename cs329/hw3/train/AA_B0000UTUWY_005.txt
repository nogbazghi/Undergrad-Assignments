I bought this set a little over a year ago - not for the "dishwasher safe " feature , but the reviews were good and it seemed to be a good value .
We never put them in the dishwasher , but the most used pieces( pans )seem to be losing their "non-stick " quality and luster .
I would look elsewhere in the future .
