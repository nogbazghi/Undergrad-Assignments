I purchased this humidifier for my son to use as we live in Florida and because he has lung congestion .
I did n't want a heated humidifier as I am always so hot and he has been sleeping in our room .
It has worked perfectly so far !
No leaks ( like the other two cheap ones we had previously ) , the noise-level is quiet , and it is light-weight and not bulky at all .
I am planning on purchasing a second one for our second son for his bedroom as well !
