At a press conference with President Loooooola , Bush gave his personal definition of democracy : â I think itâs great to be able to say a good friend won reelection because it confirms the fact that democracy is alive and well in Brazil .â 
But there are concerns : â I share your concerns about the people in democracy not receiving the benefits of democracy .â 
Youâd think that it would be hard to mistake Brazil for the United States , but ... âAnd so , Mr. President , Iâm so glad you âre here -- I mean , so glad I am here .â 
Why is he in , um , Brazil or wherever ?
âIâm reminding people that which is pretty evident , that a lot of people know that there are direct ties between our countries .â 
So heâs reminding people that people know something which is pretty evident .
Anything else ? â I bring the goodwill of the United States to South America and Central America .
Thatâs why Iâm here .
I donât think America gets enough credit for trying to help improve peopleâs lives .â 
Thatâs a pretty quick transition from âgoodwillâ  to whining petulantly about ingratitude .
âAnd so we fully understand that if thereâs illiteracy , it will affect our country eventually .â 
Especially if you âre the one with the illiteracy .
And you are , George , you are .
Indeed , one of the things Iâve observed in Bushâs speeches is just how large a proportion of the English language is â  fancy â  to him .
He added another one to that list : âThere is a lot of investment in the region , as the President noted .
Oh , for some , that âs just a fancy word , but for others who benefit from the investment through jobs , itâs a central part of their life .â 
His weekly radio address gives a preview : on Monday he will visit a great Guatemalan success story , a poor farmer who switched his crops and now sells them to... Wal-Mart .
And then , it was time to dance !

And then they made me watch an ad first . )
