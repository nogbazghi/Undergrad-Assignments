Dick Cheney gave a speech to an AIPAC conference today , where he was evidently crowned .
Or possibly given a Lisa Simpson haircut .
( A bored AP photographer must have had a bit of entertainment lining up this shot . )
He said that in The War Against Terror ( TWAT ) we have to face âthe threat directly , patiently and systematically , until the enemy is destroyed .â 
This is necessary because âAn enemy with fantasies of martyrdom is not going to sit down at a table for negotiations .â 
He did not talk only about fantasies , but also myths , specifically the âmyths about the war on terror .â 
For example , âThe most common myth is that Iraq has nothing to do with the global war on terror .
... We hear this over and over again , not as an argument but as an assertion meant to close off argument .â 
Because if thereâs one thing Dick Cheney hates , itâs assertions meant to close off argument .
9/11 ! 9/11 !
Cheney refuted that âmythâ  by quoting Loki Bin Laden , because if thereâs anyone who eschews myths and looks at the world with crystal clarity more than Dick Cheney , itâs Osama Bin Laden .
Myth number two , according to Bullfinch Cheney , is that you can support the troops without funding every Bush budget request to the last penny .
â When members of Congress pursue an anti-war strategy that âs been called slow bleed , they are not supporting the troops , they are undermining them .â 
Cheneyâs mouth watered in a creepy way when he used the words âslow bleed .â 
Myth number three is that âgetting out of Iraq before the job is done will actually strengthen Americaâs hand in the fight against terrorists .â 
Myth number four is that withdrawing from Iraq wonât lead to a domino effect .
âModerates would be crushed , Shiite extremists backed by Iran could be in an all-out war with Sunni extremists led by al Qaeda and remnants of the old Saddam regime .â 
The AIPAC members â  mouths watered in a creepy way when he mentioned Muslims fighting other Muslims .
Speaking of myths , Cheney says that Bush âunderstands , as Ronald Reagan did , that if history teaches anything , it teaches self-delusion in the face of unpleasant facts is folly .â 
Funny , I thought âself-delusion in the face of unpleasant facts â  was the Bush administration motto .
Wasnât it on the bumper stickers in â04 ?
Speaking of myths , Cheney called Ariel Sharon âa man of courage and a man of peaceâ .
He said , âEither we are serious in fighting the war on terror or not .â 
Serious face .
