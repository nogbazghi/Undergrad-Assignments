does anyone have a clue wtf ever happened to his face ?
i mean did he have a stroke or what ? to say it look strangelovian would not be an understatement .
he is like some warped cross between the peter sellers character and the george c scott character .
weird .
really , wild weird stuff .
By alliteratively mixing movie metaphors with cartoon captioning , in this photo , I envision he is about to say , " Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse are finished , see ? " mmmmm , cccc ?
