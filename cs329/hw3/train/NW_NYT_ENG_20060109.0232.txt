Throckmorton County Judge Trey Carrington has watched as wildfires
in nearby areas have claimed land , structures and even human
life , yet his sparsely populated patch of brittle , dry pasture
has been spared -- so far .
" I do n't know .
I guess it 's just pure-D old luck , " Carrington
said .
" I guess we 're just fortunate and the good Lord
is watching over us . "
The county of 1,850 residents , set between Abilene and Wichita Falls ,
is nevertheless hedging its bets .
Officials are planning to plow
fire breaks to protect the three communities : Woodson , Elbert and
the county seat , Throckmorton , where about half the population lives .
Then , they hope .
" At least we 're trying to do something , " Carrington said .
So are 37 other states , plus the District of Columbia and
Canada , who have combined to send 63 bulldozers , 57 engines ,
33 aircraft and more than 600 personnel to aid Texas .
Texas alone has employed 118 bulldozers , 54 engines , 91 aircraft and
about 1,400 people , according to the state Division of Emergency
Management .
Fortunately for Texas and nearby states that have endured rampant fires
since last month , most of the country has had adequate
moisture and faces little or no wildfire threat , allowing other
states to export resources .
The fire threat for Texas subsided slightly Monday because of higher
humidities , lighter winds and cooling temperatures .
A chance of showers in some fire-prone areas teased short-term relief
but not enough rain to cure persistent drought conditions .
Since Dec. 26 , Texas has endured more than 361 wildfires that
have burned more than 251,000 acres and destroyed at least
307 homes , killing three .
