This book is 1 of 5 in a series on different U.S. cities .
I was really impressed with the author/illustrator 's artwork and love all the neat little details that she manages to fit on each page ( so much that I met her at a book signing near DC so she could autograph it ! ) .
It is also set up in a way that even my 2 year old can enjoy the shorter , brief insets on each page , my 7 year old can enjoy and learn from the more detailed descriptions at the bottom , and even I really enjoy the beautiful artwork and have learned new things from it myself .
She captures some truly interesting highlights from each of the cities in this series (others are Cape Cod , Boston , New York , San Francisco ) .
It is a great book that I would recommend for ANY age !
