I loved mine for a year that it worked .
After about 6 uses and just less than a year , while making a cake the handle finally broke !
I was thinking of replacing it with another Kitchen Aid $ 10 spatula , but why should a spatula last only 1 year and cost $ 10 ?
They look super cool with the silver trim , but they do n't seem to be well-made .
I will have to research a NON-KitchenAid spatula because this one does not make the grade !
I am moving on to another brand .
