Just a few hours from now a Senate panel will begin a confirmation hearing for Admiral William Fallon , the man tapped to become the top U.S. commander in the Mideast .
Fallon is expected to offer a blunt assessment of the situation in Iraq .
Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr with more .
Good morning , Barbara .
Good morning , Miles .
Well , Admiral Fallon does have a long-standing reputation in the Navy as a four-star commander of being very plain-spoken , as you say being very blunt .
But political reality , as it is in Washington , is if you are going to go before the Congress for confirmation in a military position these days , one of the first things you have to say is that mistakes were made in Iraq .
That is just something that you 've got to lay out there .
Admiral Fallon will do just that .
According to his written testimony submitted to the committee ahead of time , one of the things he will say is , quote , " Securing the stability of the country " -- meaning Iraq , of course -- " securing the stability of the country has been more difficult than anticipated .
Our ability to correctly assess the political , economic , and security situation in Iraq has been lacking . "
Expect that kind of comment from Admiral Fallon .
He knows full well that he is walking into a Senate Armed Services Committee where there are at least two potential next presidents of the United States : presidential candidates Senator McCain and Senator Clinton .
And Admiral Fallon fully expects to get the question from many of these senators , what about those resolutions by Congress ?
What about those moves expressing displeasure about more troops in Iraq ?
Does Admiral Fallon feel that will tie his hands ?
Does he feel that will badly impact troop morale in Iraq to have those types of resolutions ?
We will await and see what his answer is , Miles .
