Just like Dudley Moore in Blake Edwards ' movie " 10" , Chick Best sees a woman from afar , characterizes her as the perfect woman , falls in love and becomes obsessed .
Like Dudley Moore and " 10" , Chick Best and " At First Sight " have moments where you ca n't help but laugh and see the absurdity in loving for beauty 's sake alone .
Unlike Dudley , Chick is n't cute or lovable or even likable .
Unlike Dudley Moore , Chick Best takes that obsession to a whole other level--one including murder .
And that 's what makes this book so good .
I 've read too many books where the bad guy has redeeming features--he loves his kids , he pets puppies , he 's just a normal guy in a bad situation .
Not here--Chick is pimple on the butt of society , a dot com millionaire gone bust with a trophy wife who is cheating and a goth kid into meth .
He does n't have the guts to stand up to his family or the wherewithal to try and fix anything .
He just continues in his downward spiral until he meets Paige .
Then the downward spiral turns into more of a how-to for the Seven Deadly Sins .
The book is written in multiple first persons .
I liked it .
At different points , you see what your narrator is seeing and feeling .
You see Chick convince himself how correct he is and how he is nothing but a victim fighting the injustices that have befallen him .
You then see Paige moving from a "little school teacher " to a strong , determined master of her fate .
The preface says that no one wanted Cannell to write this book .
I 'm glad he fought for it .
