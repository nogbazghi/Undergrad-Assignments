Exactly .
But see , we do n't know , you know .
In Memphis you got the Pyramid , you 've got the humun- that huge bridge downtown , you 've got --
Mm .
-- the naval base , the big naval base in Millington , you know , we just have a lot of stuff down here , but you just never know what 's gonna happen and when it 's gonna happen .
Yeah , you do n't .
Just like September eleventh .
Nobody knew , you know , that that day was gonna come .
Mhm .
And just think though , what if , what if it hadda happened , like , say eleven o'clock , twelve o'clock , noon , instead of eight thirty in the morning .
Mhm .
You know , just think how many more people would have been in them two buildings --
Yeah , exactly .
-- than they were that morning .
Yeah .
You know , that 's just the way I look at it .
Yeah .
Like I -- I 'm a student , actually , at the University of Texas here , and they 've beefed up security around here immensely because of it .
Because , ah , one of George Bush 's daughters actually attends school here , and then , ah , we are probably a stone 's throw away from the capitol .
You can see the buildings from all our dorms and from campus and everything , and like , we 're the nation 's -- one of the nation 's largest universities , so they think that -- they were saying that we probably were a very likely target for any future terrorist attacks , so there 's a lot of security now , like you ca n't even drive through campus anymore and things like that .
It 's kinda scary , you know , at times .
Really ?
Mm .
Is n't that where George Bush is from , Texas ?
Yeah , he 's from Texas .
Yeah .
Yeah .
I know at first , when he first got elected I did n't really care too much for him --
Mhm .
But now , you know , I see that he 's a strong man and , you know , he stands up for what he believes in , and he 's gonna try to take care of America .
Yeah .
And not let nobody run over us .
Yeah .
' Cause at first , you know , I was , like , oh lord , you know , we got another Bush , he 's gonna play the same role his dad did .
You know , it jut kinda scared me at first .
Yeah .
But now I see , you know , that he 's gonna stand up for America , and that 's what he 's doing .
Yeah , but --
But I really think that he thought that the war was gonna be over with before , you know , now .
Mhm .
I was thinking , you know , I thought that he thought that it was gonna be like over with in a week or two .
Mhm .
You know , I do n't think that he was -- I do n't believe that he thought it was gonna last as long as it has .
