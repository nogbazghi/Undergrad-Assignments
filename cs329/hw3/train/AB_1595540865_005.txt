The King Raven series has been my introduction to author Stephen Lawhead , and as much as I enjoyed Hood , Scarlet is that much better .
Written almost entirely in first person from the viewpoint of William Scatlocke , whom Bran dubs Will Scarlet , it takes the reader even deeper into the band of outlaws leading the resistance against the Norman invaders .
Will , who has been captured and awaits hanging , is dictating his " confession " to Brother Odo , a Norman priest .
Sheriff Robert de Glanville ( Lawhead 's equivalent of the Sheriff of Nottingham ) and Abbot Hugo hope that Will will turn against Bran and the Grellon in exchange for mercy , but Will 's loyalty , like all Bran 's followers , is non-negotiable .
One thing I 've enjoyed so far is seeing Bran grow from the selfish headstrong young man he was at the beginning of Hood to the strong leader his people need .
He is still far from perfect , often acting out in anger over some Norman injustice , but he has matured enough that he can see his mistakes , admit to them and try to make amends .
One thing missing in this book , obvious since it written from Will 's perspective , is more of what is happening with Bran .
I missed that , but even through Will 's eyes we see him mature .
This book has considerably more intrigue and surprises than the first and , at least for me , was even harder to put down .
Like Hood , Scarlet is free of profanity , gratuitous violence and sex , making it a great read for the whole family .
[WARNING : There is some violence , including a hanging . ]
There is also a hint of romance , but this is the one aspect of Lawhead 's writing that , in my opinion , is lacking .
It could have been a fabulous story if there had been a bit more about Bran and Merian , but ...alas , it is n't there .
The ending is a cliffhanger and makes me glad that I discovered these books after they were all available .
