I bought one of their wine coolers .
It broke within a few months .
After two months of fighting , they finally replaced it .
That one broke too and is leaking freon .
Now they are saying it 's out of warranty and they wo n't cover it .
Most fridges have a 2-5 years on the basic system .
Avanti offers 1 .
Most fridges are repairable - the smaller Avanti 's come as a SINGLE UNIT and cannot be opened up and repaired .
I would avoid these folks if at all possible -- buy someone else .
