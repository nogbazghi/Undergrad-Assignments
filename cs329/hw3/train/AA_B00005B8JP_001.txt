When I ordered this , I thought it was CorningWare .
NOT.
It is stoneware .
A world of difference ...stoneware is heavier and susceptible to temperature shock breakage .
This may be made by " CorningWare " but it is not the original CorningWare ceramic ; which , it turns out , is no longer available .
The casserole is a nice size , but not the real McCoy .
