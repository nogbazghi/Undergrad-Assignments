I should qualify my 5 stars , because there 's not a juice extractor on this planet that is perfect -- they all have pros and cons .
But the price , quality and convenience of this one makes it a winner .
This juicer is similar to , and just as good as , the original Acme/Omega juicers .
Sure , the yield on leafy greens is n't the best , but it does carrots , beets & celery as well an any other juicer -- and quickly , too .
The yield is far better than the extractors that spit out the pulp right away .
I 've been juicing on-and-off for the last decade , and I like that the parts for this juicer store easily while the food processor stays on my counter .
BTW , if the juicer starts to rattle or spin , adding another carrot firmly will usually solve the problem .
