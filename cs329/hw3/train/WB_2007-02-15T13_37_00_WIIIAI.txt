Today Bush paid a visit to his ideological enablers at the American Enterprise Institute , which he kept calling by its initials .
He said â I appreciate what the AEI stands for , â  but he might have been thinking it was the Affiliated Engineers Inc. or Appalachian Education Initiative or Azimuth Error Indicator or Alleanza Evangelica Italiana .
Prepositions are really not his friend : âthere is one principle of which every member of every party should be able to agree onâ .
If you âre wondering , that one principle is âWeâve got to fight the terrorists overseas , so we donât have to face them here at home again .â 
In this speech , Bushâs favorite adjective âinterestingâ  was back with a vengeance : âOne of the interesting things that I have found here in Washington is there is strong disagreement about what to do to succeed , but there is strong agreement that we should not fail .â 
Isnât that interesting ?
âItâs an interesting enemy , is nât it ?â 
Arenât they just ?
âIsnât it interesting that NATO is now in Afghanistan ?â 
Fascinating .
There were also âinterestingâ  stories and quotations and , not quite the same thing , I know , but he said that various things , usually military , were âin our interests â  no fewer than 10 times .
Some things are more than interesting ; they are , in fact , amazing .
9/11 , for example , âwas an amazing turning point in the history of our country , really , when you think about it .â 
Itâs very important for you all , as citizens , to understand the blindingly obvious : âItâs important for our fellow citizens to understand a mother in downtown Baghdad wants her child to be able to walk the streets peacefully , just like mothers here in America want their children to be able to go to a playground and play peacefully .â 
âAnd the reason why I mention success is , itâs important for us to succeed .â 
At least he had a good reason for mentioning it .
His rhetoric flew to new heights of rhetoricity : âIf we were to leave this young democracy before the job is done , there would be chaos , and out of chaos would become vacuums , and into those power vacuums would flow extremists who would be emboldened ; extremists who want to find safe haven.â 
Most of the speech was devoted to Afghanistan .
â Under the Taliban , free enterprise was stifled .
Today , the Afghan economy has doubled in size since liberation .â 
Admittedly , that gain was entirely in the , ahem , agricultural sector .
But of course he wants to put an end to that : â I have made my concerns to President Karzai pretty clear -- not pretty clear , very clearâ .
And there is nothing more terrifying that George Bush trying to make himself very clear .
For example , what does he really think about poppy production ?
âThese poppy growers are trying to make a living .
And the idea is to provide these farmers with credit , and seeds , and fertilizer , and assistance to bring their products to market .â 
Well , Iâm sure theyâll appreciate it .
Weâre helping Afghanistan in other ways as well : âitâs in our interest and the interest of NATO countries to provide training so they have more , more strong fighters .â 
Also , weâre helping restructure the country âs hilariously corrupt judicial system because âThereâs nothing more discouraging when justice is not fair .â 
Weâre sending them prosecutors , judges and lawyers to help , because when you see a country that âs really fucked up , your first thought is â I know !
Letâs send lawyers !â 
He says this job âmust be neat , really .â 
But it is a thankless task : âAnd I cannot thank our citizens for taking time out of their lives to go . â 
What we really need to send are some cowboys : â Taliban and al Qaeda fighters do hide in remote regions of Pakistan -- this is wild country ; this is wilder than the Wild West .â 
Like Deadwood , but without all the creative swearing .
And why is it important again ?
âAnd a victory for the forces of liberty in Afghanistan will be a resounding defeat in this ideological struggle .â 
