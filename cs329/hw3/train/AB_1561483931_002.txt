Nolt does an excellent job of opening up the early beginnings of the Amish to their present day frozen in time establishment .
He follows many unique families as they struggle for survival , and a home .
My only wish would be is additional focus on doctrines and beliefs ; and the problems that are created .
I realize though , that that was not the objective of the book .
There is a large bibliography , end-notes , and it is fully illustrated .
We begin in 17th century Europe with the founder , a man named Jakob Ammann .
Knowledge on Ammann is obscure .
After struggles with doctrines , the Amish , along with the Mennonites branched off from the Anabaptists .
After this schism occurred over doctrines , many petty , the Amish found themselves looking for a new homestead .
They spread over Europe ; many were persecuted , some left freely from Switzerland and eventually found themselves settling in Pennsylvania .
Small settlements can be found all over the eastern half of the United States to this day .
It is a testament to their resolve that they survived at all .
In time , decreased numbers would force mergers .
They still live on the "edges of American society " with their close knit structure .
The encroaching world continues to challenge their Christian faith .
Though , through all this they are still growing and expanding .
My thoughts , well , I think they are an example for all : their faith in the inerrancy of the Bible , moderation , love , kindness , and forgiveness .
But , they have allowed old customs to stand in the way of growth .
They have taken certain scripture as literal when it is meant to be taken figuratively .
Where does it say that we should live in the 17th century ?
Sharing of their faith is greatly needed in this broken world , but they choose to isolate themselves .
Blessings
