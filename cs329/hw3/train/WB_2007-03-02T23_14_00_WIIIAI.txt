Bush went to a school in Indiana today , to push for âstandardsâ  and âaccountability .â 
For other people , of course .
And definitely not for a surprise episode of â  Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader ?
â  Yes itâs time to renew the No Child Left Behind Act .
He talked a lot about âmeasuring , â  pretending that high-stakes testing is just a passive assessment .
Bush said , â I know full well that to make sure a system does nât lapse into kind of the safety of mediocrity that you âve got to measure .â 
Then he just sighed and whispered âthe safety of mediocrity .â 
Dare to dream , George , dare to dream .
â In life , â  he went on , âif you lower the bar you get lousy results .â 
You know , I could say something sarcastic about George Bush coming out against lowering the bar , but that would be too easy , it would in fact just be lowering the bar for sarcasm .
He said , âTesting data has helped teachers tailor instruction .
... Thatâs why the act is called the No Child Left Behind Act .
It does nât say âall children should nât be left behind ,â  it says , âno child .ââ 
You just blew my mind .
He praised the school he was in for achieving the supreme pinnacle of success , an applause line during a presidential photo-op : â I appreciate so very much that this school has met state standards for progress under No Child Left Behind every year since 2002 .
Isnât that interesting ?
( Applause . )
Isnât it interesting to be able to say that ?
You canât say something that draws applause unless you measure .â 
Oh sure you can .
Try this one : âIce cream for everyone !â 
