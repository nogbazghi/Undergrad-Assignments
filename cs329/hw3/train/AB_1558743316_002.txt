A 2nd helping of Chicken soup for the soul is a beautiful , beautiful , book .
Just a minute ago I read reviews for the first book , and I was apalled at what some people wrote .
I do n't know how people could be so insensitive that they should not be moved by such a wonderful book .
I first read the Chicken Soup for the Soul books one day two years ago when I was sitting in my living room , trying to think of something to do .
I spotted those books , and decided to try one of them .
I read my first story and found myself almost in tears .
I was truly moved by the kindness of one person .
I spent the rest of the day reading the books , and by the end of the day I had resolved to try and show the kindness I had read about in those books .
Today I feel I am a better person because of those books .
I reccomend them to any kind of soul !
