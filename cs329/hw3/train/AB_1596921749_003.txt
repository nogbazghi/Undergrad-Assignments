I do n't read as much mystery as I should .
But even with my relative inexperience in the genre , I found some very striking flaws with the Rabbit Factory .
For starters , it does n't read so much like a novel as it does a script for a pilot episode for some cheesy 1980s action series that Stephen J. Cannell would snub his nose at .
I really could n't understand what all the fuss is about regarding this book .
It is just not that good .
These are a few reasons why the book did n't set right with me :
1 . Too much information - Do we really need to know every detail of the hero 's life ?
Do we need to know about his father 's romantic life ?
Do we need to know every thing about his little brother 's gambling habit ?
2. Biggs ' jokes - Biggs claims to be a comedian who is working as a cop until his comedy career takes off .
I guess that means he 'll die a cop .
He even has to tell an obligatory " I saved money by switching to Geico " joke .
Even when Lomax infers that Biggs ' jokes are not funny , Karp presents the jokes as if HE thinks they are - or else he would n't tell them in the first place .
3. The ending - The last few pages when everything is "revealed " are pointless if you read everything up until then .
You already know what happened , the rest is just busywork .
4 . Failure to understand simple economics - One character in the novel is a minimum wage amusement park mascot who can somehow afford an apartment ( possibly with utilities ) , groceries , a computer with internet access , the latest videogames , CDs as gifts for his acquaintances , and some identity changing service that set him back several thousand dollars .
No other income stream is revealed , nor any hint of any savings .
How ?
I have read far worse books than The Rabbit Factory , but I find the praise for it troubling .
If a book like this is regarded as great by the critics , then how many books do they actually read - and what quality are they in ?
