The idea is great - the execution is lacking .
The suction cup does n't stick well , and falls off frequently .
Since the face is transparent , you ca n't read it on a dark colored dishwasher .
This would n't be an issue on a white dishwasher , but it 's useless on my black one .
Not worth sending it back since the postage was twice as much as the product .
