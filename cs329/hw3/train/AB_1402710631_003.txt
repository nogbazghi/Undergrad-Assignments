It 's not a good sign when the very first logic puzzle in a collection called CLASSIC LOGIC PUZZLES is defective !
The goal of the first puzzle is to have the reader match up three family members with their respective automobiles .
Try as I might , I was unable to completely narrow it down .
Swallowing my pride , I then checked the solution in the back of the book .
Using logic that escapes me , the author declares that the SUV must belong to the teenage son because this vehicle is brand new .
What the? ! None of the information provided in the puzzle leads to this conclusion .
The author must live in a world where teenage sons always drive new cars !
I 'm afraid to look at the rest of the puzzles in this book .
If any of the other solutions are as non-sensical as this one , I 'd rather spare myself the frustration .
