Hard to review something so boring , but this replacement kit does a fine job .
I really do n't like using bags at all but this is pretty easy to change out and it 's always nice to put on a fresh filter too .
Fein did a nice job with this kit and I would recommend using genuine Fein parts and accessories if you own one of their shop vacs .
