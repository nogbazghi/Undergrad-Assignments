I bought 2 of these humidifiers less than a year ago without reading the reviews .
There 's nothing " Carefree " about them ...constant cleaning is a must , and I 've replaced the 4 filters twice ( at $ 8 each plus shipping ... I could n't find them at any store ) .
Cleaning the filters per the manufacturer 's instructions was a pointless waste of time .
I have water with slightly high iron content , but I filtered it & still had problems .
They were both due for yet another cleaning last night and halfway through I decided I 've invested too much time in these " carefree " units and threw them away .
