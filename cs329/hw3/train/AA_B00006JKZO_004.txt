Very nice product .
Some people complainted about the amount of noise it makes , i really did n't notice that much noise .Maybe i got used to it really quickly or something buuut its really not bothersome .
Fridge looks great and can be set VERY cold to possibly be used as a freezer ( not sure tho , havnt tried yet ) .
Only complaint is that standard beer bottles dont fit vertically , you have the lie them on their side .
but thats really not a big deal .
Very happy i bought this .
