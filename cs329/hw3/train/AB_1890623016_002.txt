Henty , that scarily prolific writer of historical "boy 's books , " is splendidly fun reading and may be quite different from your expectations .
Though this novel begins rather poorly , with various tortured exposition-heavy conversations and stilted dialogue , it improves rapidly and actually gets quite suspenseful in its last third .
A " story of the times of Hannibal " but not the story of Hannibal , the novel follows the first three major battles--all victories--of the Second Punic War : the Trebia , Lake Trasimene , and Cannae .
Although Hannibal is a character and appears in several scenes , the novel centers around the "young Carthaginian " Malchus , a cousin of Hannibal serving as a captain in his army .
Malchus ships out with his fellows who believe in Hannibal 's fight against Rome ( contrasted with the self-serving , pacifist and greedy policy of Hanno " the Great , " a powerful statesman in Carthage ) and demonstrates his courage and ability in a variety of actions , including the three battles above but also the siege of Saguntum , a Rome-allied city in Spain , and the perilous crossing of the Alps .
In what is perhaps the book 's best episode , Malchus is sent back to Carthage by Hannibal to plead for reinforcements so that Rome may be conquered , and falls into a web of suspicion and betrayal , seriously compromising his faith in his homeland .
Eventually Malchus will also visit Rome , allowing the novel to contrast the dynamic and vital Rome of republican years with the leisure loving , flabby and deluded Carthage .
Henty weaves his history with his fiction in a relatively odd manner , usually relating the details of an event up front in a solid chunk of historical reporting , then back-tracking to detail Malchus ' involvement within the event .
This may prove too distracting to readers looking for a well-rounded novelistic treatment of the times ( as might be found in Robert Graves , for instance ) , but it succeeds perfectly in achieving what Henty set out to achieve : namely , interesting young readers in history by making it seem real and exciting .
