This book was very helpfull in creating a new area of the campaining world .
The new races , feats , skill , ect. . where very creative .
The best part of the book for me was the detailed list of locales in which the players may visit .
Overall I thought this to be an exellent book for anyone wishing to add the fairy realm to their game .
