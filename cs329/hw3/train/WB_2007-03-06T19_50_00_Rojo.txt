I think you can forgive yourself for using "in other words . "
In your case it was to actually use other words in order to further elaborate the implications of the prior words .
When Bush uses the phrase he does n't actually use other words , he uses the same words rearranged .
In other words , were Bush to have used that phrase in this particular example , he would have said : " [Samarra] was designed to provoke retaliation ...
And the result was a tragic escalation of sectarian rage and reprisal .
In other words , the escalation of sectarianism resulted from an attempt to provoke retaliation . "
And , if one wants to emulate Bush to the fullest : While uttering the latter element of that locution , it of utmost importance to chop the air with you hand and nod tendentiously as if you are revealing some truth that has hitherto been hidden from your audience , who are obviously constitutionally incapable of understanding statements of cause and event .
Which , of course , would be different from being Constitutionally incapable of restraining imperial adventurism cause and event .
In other words , [chopping air ] restraining the President via the US Constitution is not the same as understanding simple English .
