I bought this hand blender to make soup and it did an awesome job--so much easer to blend the soup right in the the pot than putting small batches of soup through a regular blender one at a time .
Lately I 've been using it to make smoothies and I think I 'm in love .
It 's so fast and easy and the cleanup is a breeze !
I put my old blender away and have n't used it since I bought this thing .
