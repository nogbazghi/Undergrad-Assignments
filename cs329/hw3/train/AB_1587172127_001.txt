This is an awesome book for girls who are inundated with Princess stories .
This is a new take on the traditional princess .
The main character , Princess Rosamund , is plain but honest , kind and intelligent .
Through her kindess , bringing forward the beauty inside , Rosamund is turned into a beautiful , rich young girl and finds her true love -- a prince who appreciates " good books more than good looks " .
The beautiful villianess ultimately turns hideous , reflecting the quality of her heart & character .
My 6 yr old daughter loves this book , which we 've borrowed from the library numerous times .
Now she gets to have her own copy !
I love the lesson that it 's what 's in your heart that counts .
( And I love that Rosamund has a brain and takes care of her father 's and her husband 's kingdoms ' finances ! )
