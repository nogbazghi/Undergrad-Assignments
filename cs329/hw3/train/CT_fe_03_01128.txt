Yeah .
So I do n't miss it a third time .
Yeah , yeah , it called me a couple of times last week and I did n't accept it 'cause I was in the middle of something .
But --
Mhm .
-- it called me like three times today and it could n't find anyone .
I waited on hold for awhile and it was looking --
Yeah , it called me three t-
-- for someone .
-- this was the third time .
Oh , was it ?
That it called .
The first time I was on the phone , the second time I was picking my son up at the bus stop , so ...
Oh
I did n't -- I was surprised they called back so soon 'cause it was just --
Mhm .
-- like , not even a half hour ago that they called --
Oh .
-- the first time , so -- so , you just wait until they find somebody to talk ?
Yeah , it puts you on hold and then plays music and says it 's looking --
Mm .
-- for someone .
Huh .
And it came on a couple of times and said , " I 'm still looking , do you want to keep holding " or whatever , but --
Yes .
Yeah .
So , it was n't too bad .
And I wonder what the purpose is of us talking about going back in time ?
I know , yeah .
It made me think of that movie -- what was that movie ?
Back to the Future .
Oh , yeah .
Ah , yeah .
That really confuses me , like the whole time travel thing 'cause --
Yeah , I do n't know --
-- I think about like ...
I thought that 's what we were going to talk about .
I was like , " But man , I do n't know anything about that kind of stuff " --
Yeah .
-- I 'm actually not interested in that as far as , you know --
Right .
-- science and all that kind of stuff --
Right , yeah .
-- was concerned , so I was a little bit --
-- curious how they --
-- how they work that , but ...
Yeah , yeah .
Stuff that I regret -- I do n't regret a whole lot .
It does n't do any good to regret , but --
Right .
Yeah .
Ah , to go back and spend time with people or to do something differently .
Mhm .
I guess that would change the outcome --
-- of your --
That 's the important thing .
Of your existence or whatever .
Yeah , Yeah
So
Yeah , yeah .
Are we just supposed to talk until they tell us to stop ?
I 'm not really sure .
I have no idea .
I 'll have to look --
I --
-- up my little piece of paper here .
