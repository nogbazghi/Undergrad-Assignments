I have owned this unit for about a week .
The design and features are good and the unit works very well - when it works .
Some of the quality seems to have been lost on manufacturing .
The main issue I have had is that the water tanks do not mate well with the base .
There is a small post in the base that is supposed to open the valve on the bottom of the tank , but it is either too short or is off center .
The result is that one ( or both ) tanks fail to supply water .
Unless the unit is dry , it is very difficult to tell if the valve has been opened .
It 's worthwhile to note that the same problem exists with another Holmes humidifier ( different model - smaller unit ) that we purchased .
Aside from the water tank issue , I have also noticed that the unit vibrates quite a bit .
It would appear that the fan is out of balance .
I did call the Holmes customer service line , but hung up after about 10 minutes on hold .
Overall , I was surprised ( and pleased ) with the simplicity of the design .
If it were not for the manufacturing deficit , I would be quite happy with the unit .
Even so , the unit is overpriced .
I would have expected to pay $ 50 ( maybe $ 35 for the cheap manufactured version ) .
