It may have a strong motor , but it howls like a military jet on afterburers .
What 's worse , the beaters are made of flimsy wire .
After a few uses , nothing very hard , they were bent and out of balance .
Now the off-kilter beaters make a terrible racket as they bang together .
We had an old Cuisinart food processor that was pretty reliable , so we bought this mixer based on the brand .
We bought one of their coffee grinders as well .
Both have been only fair to poor .
Be warned .
