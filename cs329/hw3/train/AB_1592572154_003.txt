This is the first numerology book I 've purchased and it was very useful !
It is very easy reading ( hence the title " the IDIOT 's guide . . .
" ) and I was able to get a lot of information on different areas of my life .
I thoroughly enjoyed this book because it went in to a lot more detail than just a simple 2 sentence-long definition of each number .
Instead , the book included references to the tarot , and how each number affects different parts of your life .
There 's a chart included in the back of the book for keywords about each number .
If you are new to numerology like I am , I highly recommend this book .
One more interesting note to point out before I end this , the book was dead-on about me and my numbers .
My family , however , did n't experience the same thing .
Some parts were "on " and some were n't .
The book worked for me though so I really enjoyed it .
