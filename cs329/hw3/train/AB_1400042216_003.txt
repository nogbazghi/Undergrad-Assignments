I love this book .
Reich explains in great detail how progressive ideas and ideals are the true hope for America and how the conservative , regressive programs of the right-wing are bad for America .
He uses examples , gives details , explains things .
It 's really a wonderful read .
That said , you probably have to be a real political junkie to really enjoy it .
At times , it 's kind of dry reading .
Then again , if you picked up the book in the first place , you probably already ARE a political junkie .
This book offers essential ammunition for combatting the right-wing smear mearchants who prefer to talk in sound bites and remember the good old days of " separate , but equal . "
