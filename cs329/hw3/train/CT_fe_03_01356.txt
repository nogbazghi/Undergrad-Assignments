And I think people , they were saying some of the neighbors were --
Yeah .
-- upset that she would do that .
Yeah , yeah .
I can see that .
I --
Yeah .
But it was funny , where -- where I was living in -- in Houston , that s where I grew up .
Mhm .
The people were kinda the same way .
They said ,  I just cant believe that person is a -- is a , uh , actress !
You know ?
Right .
And you -- youre like , going , Wow !  Kinda like your Harry Potter comment .
Right .
Right .
You know , why would you do it , or whatever ?
No, were very , very conservative here .
When I first came up here to go to college , because I was raised in florida , um , I could nt believe , um , you know , how conservative it was around here .
N- and -- and nothing was open on Sunday , and people just did the whole , you know , they stayed home on Sunday .
Yeah .
It -- did you hear a beep ?
Uh 
I heard like , a little beep , I hope it s not my battery in my phone !
I did nt , and mine was starting to warble , uh , were new to cellphones -- Im talking on a cellphone --
Uh-huh .
-- and it s -- it just drives me nuts .
Does it ?
I just think it should be like the regular phone and --
Right .
-- work all the time and stuff .
And plus you can be places and it just quits .
Oh God !
And youre going like , you know , so anyway , that s something .
But I dont think it was mine , it couldve been your battery .
It couldve been because this is the phone that is hooked up to my computer , so I dont use it that much .
That -- that s the bane of our existence , all the batteries running down in --
I know !
-- in phones .
Its just -- it s literally stupid .
I know , it is , youre right .
Well , how do you like this -- so I -- Im one of the few people in the world who does nt have a cellphone because I really dont want anyone calling me right now !
Well , I -- Im with you .
And it s kinda dumb because my girlfriend got one .
Yeah .
Uh , shes starting -- she started working kind of across town and she does nt like to ever running out of gas or whatever .
Mhm .
Well , so then , it was --
-- Okay and it was kinda neat to call her if she was at the store or something .
Well then , we had Verizon , it was twenty bucks more and they gave you a free phone .
Twenty bucks more a month .
