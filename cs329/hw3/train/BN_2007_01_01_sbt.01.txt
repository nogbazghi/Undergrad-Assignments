Not particularly , no .
You`re won over by a couple extra pounds ?
Yes .
It` s nice to have a little flab , a little cushiness to sleep on .
It` s always nice to see somebody and say , Hey , you know what ?
I could - I could get that , you know ?
Man flab is in .
What does that do for you ?
That` s really gross .
OK , so it looks like the jury is still out on this one .
But let us tell you , there is a certain security that comes with someone who` s carrying a few extra pounds .
O`KEEF
There` s a certain security and a - and a certain level of caring that - that comes with this person that is average , and that has a little bit of a midsection .
It` s that that person is n` t spending enough time - is spending too - is n` t spending too much time in the gym , is n` t spending too much time worrying about themselves .
Yes , just take it from this guy .
He just finished a hot dog when we caught up with him .
You got to have a little extra ( INAUDIBLE ) something to hold onto , you know what I mean ?
You ca n` t be all skin and bones .
I think that stuff - yes , that` s old .
We do n` t want him to have a flatter stomach than us .
O`KEEF
I truly believe that this is the century of the average American , and that Hollywood is just starting to catch up .
I mean , you could say it` s shaping up to be the true century of the average man .
Literally shaping as far as the midsection in Hollywood .
You know , it was n` t just men as the focus of this body image debate .
2006 became the year of curves .
Coming up , a salute to the female stars who did n` t give in to the rail-thin Hollywood mold .
We`ll also have this .
Oh , my god .
Oh , my god .
Oh , my god .
Here come the tears .
Yes , he` s a little excited .
A very dramatic moment when Headline Prime` s very own Nancy Grace made a surprise appearance on our set .
Richard Simmons in the interview you`ll see only on SHOWBIZ TONIGHT.
I` m starting to get weepy thinking about that already .
A lot of people got weepy seeing this picture .
We could n` t look back at 2006 without talking about controversy .
From Mel Gibson to Anna Nicole to Britney Spears , there were lots of choices .
We`re going to tell you who we named the most controversial celebrity of 2006 .
That` s coming up .
Welcome back to SHOWBIZ TONIGHT.
It` s 30 minutes past the hour .
I` m A.J. Hammer in New York .
And I` m Sibila Vargas in Hollywood .
This is a special edition of TV` s most provocative entertainment news show : " The Best in SHOWBIZ 2006 ."
Well , in 2006 , we introduced " The SHOWBIZ Weight Watch , " and all year we covered of Hollywood and body image like nobody else .
We took a stand : we are sick and tired of super-skinny models and actors sending a horrible message to their fans - especially kids who look up to them as role models .
