A flurry of new reports of avian influenza
in humans and animals emerged Sunday from various parts of
Turkey , and international health officials said they believe the disease
had been simmering in the eastern part of the country
for months , even though it was only reported there in
late December .
Representatives of the World Health Organization , and the Turkish health minister ,
were heading to the worst-hit areas in and around the
city of Van , in remote , eastern Turkey .
Four children from villages near Van have been confirmed to be
infected with the H5N1 strain of avian influenza , the first
human cases outside East Asia .
Like many people in these
poor villages , the four had had close contact with birds ,
health officials said , and probably were infected as a result .
Turkish officials announced Sunday that tests had confirmed five new cases
of H5N1 , including two more in Van and three around
the capital , Ankara .
The Ankara cases have the most alarming implications because bird flu
had not been previously reported in that part of the
country .
In addition to confirmed cases , some 50 other people suspected of
having the disease have been hospitalized , at least 30 in
the Van area and about 20 in Ankara , a Health
Ministry spokesman said .
Maria Cheng , a WHO spokeswoman in Geneva said scientists studying the
H5N1 virus samples from Turkey had so far detected no
changes that might make it more contagious to humans .
The cluster of cases in Turkey is extraordinary and a cause
for concern , scientists said .
In all of East Asia , where
the disease has been running rampant in birds for years ,
only about 140 people have been infected .
By evening , the Agriculture Ministry said that 10 of 81 provinces
were reporting the disease in birds , up from three just
a few days ago .
Although H5N1 does not readily spread between humans , scientists are worried
it may evolve that ability setting off a worldwide pandemic .
