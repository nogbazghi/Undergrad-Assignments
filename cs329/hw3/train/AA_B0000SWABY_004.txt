I 'm not really a vacuum cleaner expert , but I 've had quite a few ones purchased from regular stores such as Home Depot , Wal-Mart etc. , and none has been as good as this one ! ! ! !
Even though the vacuum is rather large in size , its weight is surprisingly light , comparing to even smaller units .
It 's also very quiet and it does a great job of picking up everything on the carpet .
I was using it to clean a floor full of Styrofoam crumbs , and it picked up all of them , despite the static !
I am very pleased with this vacuum 's performance , and I hope it will last a long time !
