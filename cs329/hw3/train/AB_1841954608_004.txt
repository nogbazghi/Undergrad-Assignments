One of the worst novels I have read ...ever .
Not as bad as Ellis ' Crooked Little Vein , but pretty bad .
I felt there was no real character development ; if anyone says that they can relate to Vernon , they are lying .
Everything about the book 's dialog and narration is choppy .
It all appeared to be useless rambling that I just knew was going to point somewhere in the end ...but it did n't .
We all get that it is a satire and not necessarily a "laugh-out-loud"-er like Catcher , but I remember laughing harder at J.Swift than this piecer .
Really , this novel does nothing for the reader .
I heard a lot of positive things about Vernon God Little , but it did little to capture .
And now I am rambling just as bad as Pierre did starting page one .
