I bought the Sanyo SC-270 last year and was initially very pleased with the strong suction and portability .
After a short time I became dissappointed with how quickly the filter clogs and how messy it is to clean with the tools provided ( hands in the filth ) .
Also , the tubing and attachments are very 'cheap ' and easily fall apart .
Overall , I expected a bit more ...though , when clean and fully functioning , the suction is excellent .
