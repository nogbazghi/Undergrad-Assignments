Yeah , no , I 'm sure you could .
It 's funny that we have a President that was not elected by the popular people --
Mhm .
Yeah .
-- and he 's taken us to war .
Exactly , now it 's crazy .
And that bothers me .
Yeah .
You too ?
Oh , good .
Yeah .
You know , he is not our popular choice and now we 're in one war and now he 's talking about getting us into another war .
Yeah , I -- I know .
That 's kind of a bother something to me and I , you know , I believe in my political party and I 'm not going to get this into political things , but --
Uh-huh .
-- um , I do n't know .
I just think , you know , he -- he strived on how he was so pro life for one thing --
Mhm , Mhm .
-- and yet then he goes into war and he kills all these people and all of our little --
Mm .
-- innocent boys -- I mean , you 're twenty .
You said you were twenty --
Mhm .
You 're twenty .
People your age --
Yeah .

Yeah .
Oh , it just --
N- --

Yeah , it 's hard to think about .
It just bothers me .
Yeah .
You know and I listen to you and I think , you know , you 're young and -- and I -- I do n't feel that much older than you but I am and I think , " Oh , dear lord , it 's just not right to do to people your age" .
Yeah .

Yeah , exactly .
I do n't know , but god , I do n't want to see people your age going to war and getting killed .
No, n- yeah , no , me neither .
Oh .
Yeah .
I do n't know .
Yeah , it 's really --
I guess there 's no easy way .
Mhm .
You know , look at the age you are and I 'm sure you know people that have gone over there .
I do , I know people and -- believe me , I 'm forty one --
Oh .
-- and I know people who have kids that are there .
Really ?
I actually do n't know anyone who 's --
-- who 's -- who 's been over there .
I -- I know a few and , uh , god it --
Wow .
