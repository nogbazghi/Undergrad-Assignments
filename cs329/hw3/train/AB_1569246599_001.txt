Gordon Livingston writes with clarity and honesty about the illness and death of his beloved youngest son , and the aftermath he and his family endured .
The book faithfully captures the roller coaster of emotions that accompany the trajectory of illness , as well as the benumbed unreality of such a shocking loss when death occurs .
A beautifully brave account of moving into and through a fog of despair , doubt , and guilt , eventually giving way to a ray of hope and light .
