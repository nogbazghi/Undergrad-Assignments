the product is pretty cheaply built ; but actually works great....pumps lots of moisture into the air .
downside ...it is very noisy ; so much in fact i run it only on speed 1 ( it has 9 speeds ) .
the noise is not only just fan noise , but the fan motor is very noisy as well .
i 'm very unhappy with the noise level ; but have n't found anything better regarding moisture output .
i also have two smaller hunter units which are almost impossible to hear ; too bad hunter does n't make a larger model ...i buy it in a second .
