Experts in the field including the FBI reveal that the apparent increase in female youth violence represents a policy change in the arrests for family violence .

There is no reason for this book with its false claims to have been published .
The claims are consistent with the media hype and anti-feminist sentiment but not with the criminal justice statistics .
