It 's Friendship Day ! On Friendship Day friends around the world have parties and wear special friendship bracelets .
The problem is , sneaky Swiper has been swiping friendship bracelets from all over the world !
Dora 's World Adventure follows Dora , Boots , Diego , and Swiper the Fox to four locations : the Eiffel Tower in France , Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania , the Winter Palace in Russia , and the Great Wall of China .
In each country , Dora interacts with various friends , saying "hello " in the native tongue .
For example , when in Tanzania , Dora meets up with her friend N'Dari ; in that country , "jambo " means hello .
Dora 's World Adventure is an excellent book for introducing children to world geography and world cultures .
My son has been asking about the various countries , relating various cultural aspects and landmarks that he learned from the book .
In the back of the book is a perforated glow-in-the-dark bracelet that your child can wear , which is a nice added touch .
My son also also has the CD-ROM game of the same name , which is also very good .
