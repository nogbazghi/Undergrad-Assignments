-- a rat 's arse .
--
"-- you know , your girlfriend dumped you . "
--
Oh .
-- and I was just -- it -- I was so -- I was actually -- I got kinda crabby about things that just seemed --
-- inconsequential --
-- that people made a big deal about .
Yeah .
You know , like , even people at work , you know , somebody would complain because they gotta paper cut and --
-- I 'd just feel like , oh -- you know , I would n't say anything but I just feel like " Keep it to yourself there is so much worse going on . "
Oh , yeah
so , at least , you know , that kinda crabbiness and irritability --
-- ah , faded away with -- with like this other shock .
I think that 's the best way to put it , once --
-- the shock fades .
Yeah .
It -- it was very strange for me because I just started a new relationship --
Mhm --
And now it 's been , like , what , a year and seven months --
Mhm --
Since then , and , like , when you first get into a brand new relationship , you know , you 're kinda trying to see -- kinda figure out who that person is --
Yeah --
-- and see if you guys have similar I guess views on topics and gees , we did n't talk about anything else for a couple of days just I was real depressed and sad and everything and --
Mhm --
-- he was a big comfort .
That 's a really good way to cut through the superficialities of meeting somebody and get right to what matters .
Yeah , when you think about , you know , I met him at a b - at a bar
ya
it 's not quite as romantic , but .
but when you spend those first few days talking about something that --
-- affects you so deeply .
Definitely .
I think maybe that 's , ah , you know , a -- a silver lining to a tragedy is that you probably got to know this -- this person that you , you know , wanted to get to know better , you probably got to know him much better than you would have otherwise --
Definitely --
-- you know --
And it --
-- at -- at a much deeper level .
Yeah , it helps you to be able to talk about other things that are very important issues as well , you feel more able to speak about them .
Yeah , whereas otherwise it would be like , " So , what 's your favorite color ? "
Yeah , like , --
What movies --
-- do you like ?
Yeah , --
Yeah .
-- but it like -- for controversial things too , like when you know somebody 's kinda view point on something like that you can kind of figure out like -- or assume rather what oth - what their other view points would be about certain issues and --
