I had searched forever for a nontoxic alternative to heating up frozen dinners in their own plastic trays .
Until I found this CorningWare 23 " oval dish , none were satisfactory--too big , too narrow , too deep , too wide ... This one is perfect .
I often take frozen LeanCuisine or similar frozen entrees to work .
They 're great and a relatively healthy choice for busy folks like me--as long as I do n't have to risk the outgassing of toxic chemicals from the trays and cover when heating the food ... This CorningWare 23 " oval dish is perfectly sized to pop your typical frozen entree into before heating in the microwave .
It 's also a perfect single serving au gratin dish ... great for eggs florentine or eggplant parmigiana .
It 's also sturdy , easy to clean , has good eye appeal .
A real winner .
