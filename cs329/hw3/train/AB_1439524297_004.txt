This book is like you are being told what will happen at gladiator school .
That is what makes it funny .
Even though it is funny , you learn things .
For instance , did you know that you would have to eat barley grains and roasted beans for dinner and ash for dessert ?
Another reason I like this book is the illustrations .
The illustrations also make the book funny because they make the people look weird .
You may have read another books in the " You would n't want to " series .
As you know they are really good books .
