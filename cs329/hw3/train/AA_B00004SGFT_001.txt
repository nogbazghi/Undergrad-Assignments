My classic Kitchenaid mixer is about 25 years new and I never had a problem pouring batter from the original bowl , which had no handle .
However , my hands have become weak over the years and recently I almost dropped the entire bowl and batter on the floor - twice .
I immediately ordered a bowl with a handle from Amazon and it is wonderful .
My only complaint , if you can call it that , is that the handle is rather thin .
Kitchenaid does n't even make a 4-1/2 qt bowl with the nice ergonomic handle that they offer for their larger machines .
However , this is a relatively minor issue .
I kept my original bowl as a spare for making something light , such as egg whites or whipped cream , but for batter the handle is wonderful .
