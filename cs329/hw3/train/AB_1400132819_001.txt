I learned a great deal from this book .
I knew much about the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II--I learned much more .
I also knew a lot about WWII combat in Europe--I learned much more .
I did not know much about the 442nd Regimental Combat Team .
It should not be a surprise that I learned much about it , but , as I said , I learned many other things too .
I doubted some of the facts presented , but I checked the most important one and found that it is true--21 Japanese-Americans were awarded Medals of Honor from World War II action .
Because that fact was correct , I did not check most of the others .
I am an old artilleryman .
I had never before read of units being resupplied with critical supplies ( morphine and other drugs , small arms ammo ) via artillery fire .
I am still amazed by this , but until I can disprove it , I must believe ( and admire ) it .
I did not give a five star rating because of the long description at the end of the book where the author brings in many different ways to prove the incompetence of government and military leaders in creating the internments .
Some of this was interesting and worthy , but most had been well-demonstrated by that point in the book .
I am a better person for having read this book .
