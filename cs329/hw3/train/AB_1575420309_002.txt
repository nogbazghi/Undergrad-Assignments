As a clinically licensed Marriage & Family Therapist who has worked in a state agency for over 26 years with hard to handle youth , and also maintained a private psychotherapy practice for over 18 years , I must say that this is a VERY GOOD book .
In over 20 years of teaching a weekly 2 hour parenting class I have seen many "parenting guides " come and go , and I 'm not usually impressed by most of them .
Many of the books simply reinforce parents need for emotionally leveraging the child into compliance .
Short term looks great , long term BIG PRICETAGS. .
.( like the kids wo n't come home for Christmas holidays , when they are 25 years old . .
.etc )
I think that too many of the "guides " teach parents to be RIGHT rather than CLOSE.
In contrast to that position , the information contained in " What Kids Need to Succeed " is not only VERY pertinent to interacting with youth , but provides a basic outline of what needs are important to address with children/youth to help support them toward responsible , independent adulthood .
I believe that the suggestions are sound in terms of being research based and from my experience certainly do yield great results .
The approach is proactive and constructive , which is very reflective of what current research indicates works best .
The conceptual foundation of encouragement and empowerment is ( IMHO ) the ONLY way to help children/youth INTEGRATE constructive , growth enhancing principles , rather than just reacting to demanding adults who require compliance .
I liked the book a lot and will be adding it to the 4 other manuals that I use in teaching parenting skills .
I would guess some parents will resist this approach because it requires them to give up trying to control and dominant the child and replace it with mentoring , friendship and alliance . . .
All in all I really appreciate this book and it is required reading in all my classes now .
