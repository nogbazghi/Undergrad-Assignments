I have no problems with the Foodsaver rolls ... those seem to work flawlessly .
These pre-made bags , however , have been next to worthless .
Perhaps I just received a bad batch but only about one out of every 5 bag will even begin to evacuate much less hold a seal .
Those that do evacuate typical lose their seals after a while .
I 'm sticking with the rolls from now on .
One positive is that I can use the box these came in to store bags I 've made from the rolls for later reuse .
Other than that , these bags have been frustrating in the extreme !
