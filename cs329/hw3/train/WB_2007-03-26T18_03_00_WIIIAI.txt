He says that he and his family have been âpainedâ  by the attacks on his credibility .
â I grew up with nothing but my integrity .
And someday , when I leave this office , I am confident that I will leave with my integrity .â 
Well , can you remember when you last saw it ?
He denied that he personally had any improper motives in firing the attorneys .
â I know the reasons why I made the decision , â  he said several times , although he does nât actually say what those reasons were and heâs claiming a Reaganesque management style such that he did nât know anything at all about the work of his US attorneys and left the decisions on who to fire up to subordinates who do .
One wonders what he actually does all day .
Looks under couch cushions for his integrity , I guess .
He also said , repeatedly and specifically , that there was ânothing in the documents â  to prove improper motives .
If that is nât reassuring enough , âIâve asked the Office of Professional Responsibility at the department to look into this .
And â  they will be working , along with the Office of Inspector General , to make it clear and reassure the American people that nothing improper happened here .â 
Because nothing is more reassuring than the investigatorsâ  boss telling us what the results of the investigation will be before it has taken place .
