I did a lot of homework before deciding to buy this bad boy .
I am not a vacuum expert nor do I really vacuum .
I bought this as a Mother 's Day gift for mama-dukes .
Well , what I heard from her was that this was by far the best vacuum she had ever used , and not simply because I bought it for her for Mother 's Day .
This thing is very quiet compared to any vacuum I 've ever heard in our house .
I do n't even hear it when I am in a different room .
It is so quiet that it deceivingly feels a little weak .
But it is ANYTHING but weak . . specially when you turn on the spinning motor thingie ( it gets a little louder with that on , but not so bad . )
MY GOD , this thing sucks up EVERYTHING !
Not in a bad way where it destroys your carpets or eats your cat , but in a good way that it really digs up dirt in between the carpet and makes vacuuming a joy and extremely effortless .
Oh and if you were wondering how it punched my mom in the face . . well , while she was vacuuming under my bed , she bent down for a second to get something and the vacuum spinner thing was on and it sucked up her hair , lifted up off the floor and smacked right into her face .
The funny( ? ) thing was , she could n't reach the off switch on the handle to turn off the motor !
We all had a good laugh about it and she had a bloody lower lip for about a week .
My poor mom .
She has a great sense of humor though . . she laughs every time she tells the story .
Anyway , GREAT vacuum. . buy one !
