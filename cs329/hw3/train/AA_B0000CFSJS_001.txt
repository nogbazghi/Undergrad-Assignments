For several months I pondered getting this , but was put off by the reviews which describe a very rough bottom .
Eventually I ordered it anyway because I needed something this shape and size .
My product arrived broken , but Amazon immediately sent a replacement , no questions asked , so I am very impressed with customer service !
And much to my delight , the base of my dish is wonderfully smooth .
I have been using it frequently for several weeks , and am so pleased .
It bakes evenly , holds heat well for use as a serving dish , and is easy to clean .
What more could I ask for ?
