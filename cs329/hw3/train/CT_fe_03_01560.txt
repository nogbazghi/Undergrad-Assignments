-- that stuff .
I do n't know what that is .
I have no idea .
Quakers is like a --
I do n't know --
-- a religion .
-- you 'll have to get someone else .
You know --
I know as much about sports -- I mean , I know nothing .
Where are you at-- you 're not actually from there then ?
You just chose --
I 'm from New York .
Yeah .
I caught that New York accent !
You just chose Pennsylvania then for the school ?
Is it a good school ?
No, actually I 've lived here since I was eleven .
Oh , really ?
And I 'm thinking of going back to New York .
It 's a good me- medicine school ?
Uh , as soon as I graduate I plan on opening a practice in New York .
' Cause actually IUs got , um , a fairly good medicine school that it 's known for --
Yeah .
NYU.
Who ?

Oh , okay .
No, I was talking about IU , which is Indiana .

You must have two phone lines ?
You 're able to be on the computer when the phone call came in ?

Although my next door neighbor listens to such loud rap music I do n't think they would notice if I was , uh , being killed in here .
Okay , it 's off .
I said you 're lucky .
It sounds like you have two phone lines .
You were able to answer the phone call from the University of Penn at the same time as the computer 's on .
Well , I 'm not on the Internet .
Oh , you 're not on the Internet .
Okay .
No, I just turned on my computer .
' Cause , I -- you know , I miss more of these phone calls from the University of Penn , friends , whatever , because I 'm just so addicted to the Internet , and we only have one phone line and I do n't want to pay for a second phone call .
Mhm .
Well , if you have broadband you can also , uh --
Oh , right .
