This humidifier works ok .
I found humidity level pretty low , but when left on constantly it was comparable to my last " cheapie " humidifier .
Low setting is quiet , and well , low .
High setting is pretty loud and still pretty low humidity .
Before you purchase this look at your options for getting filters .
Yeah , you really only have one .
Expect to spend $ 7+ per filter that you will have to change approximately every month .
This machine WILL NOT FUNCTION with no filter or an "old " (yes , about a month ) filter !
So expect to keep paying for this one over and over by way of filters .
Wish I would have done more research into " the filter racket " before purchasing this type/model of humidifier ...
