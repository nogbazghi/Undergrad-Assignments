Some of our brave troops made the ultimate sacrifice today : listening to a speech by George Bush .
They listened to him over there ( in Fort Irwin , California ) so that you donât have to listen to him here .
He opened his remarks thus : âIâve been waiting all day to say , Hoo-ah !â 
What a rich , full , rewarding life he leads .
He thanked the troops for joining the army , which evidently people donât do in other countries : âOurs is a remarkable country when people volunteer to serve our country in a time of war .â 
He thanked the families of the troops who joined the army : â I understand that when a loved one is deployed , it creates anxiety .â 
Actually , now that I read that sentence again , it sounds kind of dirty .
âYouâre an integral part of making sure this volunteer army is as successful as it is today .â 
Dude , you âre blaming them for that ?
He says that on 9/11 âmy attitude about the world changed that dayâ .
Really ?
Wasnât his attitude about the world pretty much always that it revolves around him ? âLike many Americans , we struggle with understanding with what this attack meant .â 
Duuur , big buildings fall down boom .
âSee , what changed on September the 11th is oceans can no longer protect the people in the United States from harm .â 
I think the Indian Ocean just has nât been pulling its weight .
Stoopid Indian Ocean .
Oh , letâs just skim quickly through the rest of the speech : âmake no mistake about it , these extremists believe things -- for example , they donât believe you can worship freely ; they donât believe you should speak your mind ; they donât believe in dissent ; they donât believe in human rights .â 
I donât think you need me to MST3K that sentence for you .
If we pull out of Iraq , âThe enemy that had done us harm would be embolden .â 
On Iraq : âitâs not a civil war ; it is pure evil .â 
Heâs not the messiah ; heâs a very naughty boy .
On Congress : âThen , instead of sending an acceptable bill to my desk , they went on spring break .â 
And did nât invite him .
DIDNâT INVITE HIM !
âThe enemy does not measure the conflict in Iraq in terms of timetables .â 
They probably use the metric system , those bastards !
Stoopid metric system .
At Fort Irwin , they let him play with the bomb detonation robot ,
and they let him play with a surveillance aircraft ,
but all he really wanted to do was rub that big old bald head .
