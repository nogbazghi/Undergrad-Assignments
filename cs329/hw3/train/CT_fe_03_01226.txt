Right .
-- and she had the hard enough time with the English language as it is .
Mhm .
So , I went on the internet and I found a -- a [inaudible ] bible and my daughter took it to school and gave it to her to help her out .
Right .
And n- -- now she 's doing much better .
Yeah , she 's doing much better .
But no th - they care -- I can see that where private school kids care more -- they get more as a group , a very small room .
Is it -- do you think it 's because they get more money ?
Oh , the air raid sirens over Baghdad .
The teachers ?
They what ?
Air raid sirens over Baghdad [inaudible ] --
I heard that about five minutes ago , already .
So --
Oh , my gosh .
-- depends on which channel you 're watching .
Yeah .
ABC had it on first .
Oh , wow .
ABC just had it on .
Yeah , I 'm on Fox .
Oh .
Oh , that 's a little behind ABC yet , so .
But --
Yeah .
-- bye bye ,
Wow .
Okay .
I have n't heard that we 're doing anything , but that 's not our subject , right ?
Okay .
Oh , no I 'm sorry .
Okay .
So , any way ...
So , what you -- how many -- how many kids do you have in school ?
Ah , just the one .
Just one ?
Just the one .
But I --
See now -- and in --
-- I went through public school system too and the school system that I went to the year that I graduated they produced the most , um , illiterate children in the nation , that year .
Mm .
Is n't that wonderful ?
I 'm so proud .
Uh-huh .
Right .
Just what you wanted to be a class of , huh ?
Yeah , I was really proud to hear that .
So , I thought , " Oh , thank you .
Yes , yes , yes " .
Well -- well , see all three of mine are now going to college .
Oh , that 's wonderful .
But out of that , two of them chose private colleges .
Oh , that 's wonderful .
One went to a state university .
Mhm .
Now , they all went to the same high school , you know , but I say that out of those two they went to the private school --
Mhm .
-- because they grew up with the small classes and everything --
Oh , sure .
-- they would never have made it at a state university .
The one that chose to he was the outgoing kid , he could make it , you know , and he did .
Right .
But they 're all in college .
Well , my daughter 's bounced around three or four different ones , she does n't know what she wants to do .
Right .
But -- I -- I do n't know what her problem is some days .
