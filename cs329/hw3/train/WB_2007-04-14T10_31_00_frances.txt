Whenever I look at Chaney I am struck by what a loss his choice to become a political meglomaniac rather than a character actor is to the world .
He has one of the greatest evil faces of all time , the gittering glasses , the left lip snarl/sneer he 's got going , the lurching/lumbering walk , the hunched shoulders , Oscar caliber .
Too bad , and too bad for us , we are stuck with him for another two years .
