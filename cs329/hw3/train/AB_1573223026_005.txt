Four people meet on New Year 's Eve on the top of a tall building with the same goal in mind .
But because of a lack of privacy , they cannot jump .
Instead , they agree to spend the next 90 days as semi-friends until they determine whether they really want to go through with it .
These are four very different people , and each gets a shot at telling the story from his or her own point of view .
The problem is that none of it really gels or becomes a real story--it just feels like a novelty act , a "what if " scenario that never grows legs .
