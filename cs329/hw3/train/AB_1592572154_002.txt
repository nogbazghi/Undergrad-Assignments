I read this book in a matter of days , it was great , I figured out my numerology as well as several others .
This is the best beginners book to numerology ever !
It was so easy to use and understand .
I am very glad I decided to purchase this instead of having some new age-y numerologist make me a report , now I can make my own .
Thanks ! !
