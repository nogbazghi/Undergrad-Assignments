What 's the question ?
I was going to ask Fantasia , what 's the most extravagant gift she has bought ?
What have you bought for yourself ?
What did I buy for myself ?
Well , I bought a home after I won for my family .
A home .
Yes , we bought a house , a big house and put everybody in it .
And I bought myself a G-wagon ( ph ) .
Where 's the house ?
In North Carolina .
Is that where you 're from ?
Yes .
What 's yours ?
Well , my hometown ?
No, what have you bought for yourself ?
Well , I have n't really had time since I won .
You know , I drive around in a Rent-A-Car .
And ...
Why ?
Well , I just -- I 'm about to go on a five month tour , actually .
So I 'm in the process now of going on tour .
So that 's going to be another six months .
I did buy a wonderful camera .
I documented all of my stuff on the road that I 've been through .
I went to the White House to meet the president .
And I got to take pictures .
So a home is in store soon , maybe by the end of the year , hopefully .
Do you like concertizing ?
Yes .
That 's what I 've done for all these years .
And I 'm excited about going on tour .
You married ?
No.
You married ?
No.
Do you want to be married ?
I would like to have some -- I 'm not married right now but would love to have somebody , a strong man there by my side .
Sooner or later .
Got anybody in your life now ?
I 've got a tour bus a crew .
You 're only 30 ?
Thirty years old .
It 's improper to ask your age .
Salem , Illinois , hello .
Hey .
I love -- Taylor , I love the new album .
I play it every day .
But I have n't heard any of your singles on the radio yet .
I was wondering when you were going to be putting one of those out .
Well , that 's a great question .
The single is " Just to Feel That Way" .
And it hopefully will be out by the end of the week , maybe in the next couple of days .
" Just to Feel That Way " is the single .
You 've got all this album .
How do you pick that one out ?
Well ...
Or does Clive Davis pick that one out ?
I think it 's instinct .
You know , you 've written songs in the past for yourself .
And I 'm a songwriter .
And then you receive songs , and Ray Charles taught me that you can sing " Georgia on My " -- you can sing " Georgia on My Mind " but not necessarily write it .
But if you feel it , you sing it .
And for me , all those songs that I was receiving , you can tell if you get that feeling .
And when you get that feeling , you cut the song .
That 's what it is all about , right ?
Yes .
Selling it .
Feeling .
And make it .
If you do n't feel it , it wo n't come across .
Do you write songs ?
Yes .
You do , too ?
Yes .
But you sing the songs of others ?
