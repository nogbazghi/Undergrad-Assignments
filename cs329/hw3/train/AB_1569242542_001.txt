I 'm soooo happy that I bought this book !
It 's a very thorough combination of a library of signs we can use to communicate with infants , beautiful music to use with the signs , and a lot of VERY GOOD ideas for crafts to accompany the related topic .
The author was right , " Roll the Ball " is a HIT in any small child class .
The book also has an index of related sources , websites and ect for signing for children .
Though this book is designed for "babies " I think it 's also good for toddlers ( or the almost walking age ) .
I mentioned this book on a discussion for small children and the discussion about the book is REALLY picking up !
