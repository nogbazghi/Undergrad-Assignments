I found many interesting things in this book that is written for the masses .
However , like exercising , everyone needs to decide or get a professionals opinion about what is good for them as an individual .
I had followed the recommendations of the book for the last 9 months to a tee besides going to the website to get my " Realage " down .
I just experienced a kidney stone that needed to be removed .
For anyone that has been through a stone ordeal knows that it is equal in pain to childbirth or more so according to my urologist .
A leading contributor of my stone was the increased intake of calcium , vitamin D , and Vitamin C that I took based on the recommendations of this book .
Were there other factors ?
Probably .
However , what is good for one person may not be good for all .
So proceed with caution .
Again , the book did enlighten me in many areas .
