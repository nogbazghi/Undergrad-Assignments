Terrible piece of junk for the price .
Or any price for that matter .
The filter gets moldy and I have been replacing it daily for a week .
The filters run about $ 13 each .
I just gave up and decided to stop using it .
I even bought the humidifier tank cleaner and that was a another waste of money .
