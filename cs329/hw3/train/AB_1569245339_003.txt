A very well written book by someone who really understands what is is like to have Chronic Hepatitis B. Mr. Green is EXTREMELY informative on ways to cope with the chronic hepatitis B infection .
He breaks down the sections of the book by months and describes everything in simple english .
He points out the important things to do during the first few months and makes you feel like you have some control over your illness .
After reading this book I realized I was not alone with my symptoms .
The book is very comforting and has loads of resources and information on the virus as well as support groups .
I have learned how to interpret my own bloodwork and feel knowledgeable enough to sit down with my doctor and ACTUALLY understand everything he is saying .
This is a must have book for someone with chronic Hepatitis B! !
