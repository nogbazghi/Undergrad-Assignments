Robert Fisk talks at some length about the Durand Line (established by the eponymous treaty ) in his book , The Great War For Civilization , and the upshot is that it was and remains one of the great failures of colonial line-drawing , separating a tribally unified Pashtun people and bringing woe to whomever sought to impose their will on the area by means of the Durand Line .
I wonder if that 's what Karzai , I believe an ethnic Pashtun himself ( although clearly more wedded to Unocal as an individual ) , was trying to tell Cheney .
If it was , I do n't wonder whether Cheney bothered to understand it ( "or whenever it was and why that 's important to today 's conflict and so forth" ) .
Such is the hubris of imperialism , it need not understand the precursors of its failures .
