I bought this item primarily for mixing powdered protein , juice , and fruit for a diet I was on .
I wanted something quick and easy as well as something portable that I might be able to use at home and work .
It has served me well for this purpose .
I have also used it for mixing pancake and cornbread mixes with milk .
You can also use it for " juicing " fruit and vegetable concoctions as long as you cut the fruit/vegs into smaller chunks .
It 's very easy cleaning and storing .
Downsides : have to hold power button throughout blending process and per instructions , you should n't blend for more than one minute at a time .
Overall , a nice product for the price .
