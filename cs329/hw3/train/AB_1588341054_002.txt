I was given a copy of this book for my birthday several years ago and spent hours pouring over its prose and its historical narratives .
I never grow tired of this book .
Credit for this work goes to its author who has accomplished the near to impossible - an engaging and personal history of Washington DC told through the destroyed architecture and the people behind the buildings and their creation .
The illustrations are gorgeous , but its Goode 's way with worlds that allows the reader to lose themselves in the history of the buildings profiled .
I would imagine that this type of book in the wrong hands would become an academic tome , dry and technical .
Goode brings the people of the District to life for the reader , and compels the reader to look for more .
If the book fails , it is in the lack of a comprehensive map of the whole District of Columbia .
If you are not familiar with the streets and layout of the city ( itself genius ) then the book can be confusing .
Ideally , I would suggest this as a gift to anyone interested in history , city planning , government or historical architecture .
