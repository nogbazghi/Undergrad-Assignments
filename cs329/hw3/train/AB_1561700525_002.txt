I 've read several of her books and decided to try the CD.
I have a severe to profound Hearing loss and use a neck loop for my music .
I decided if I wanted to relax I was going to try with out any aide .
I could hear the music but not her speaking but it must have been just the touch because I woke up 3 hours later .
Her voice is very soothing .
Well worth buying if you have problems with stress .
Put it on and stretch out after a long hard day !
