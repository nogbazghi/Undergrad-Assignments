[inaudible] .
-- I wanted him to dress like I did when I was at school , you know ?
Right .
Right .
And they do n't do that .
They just do n't do that --
No.
-- unfortunately .
No.
Yeah .
I do n't think that 's probably gonna ever get that , you know --
No.
-- that way ever again .
No. No.
We were -- it 's just one of them things that we are --
Well , I think ...
-- everybody has their own -- their own style I think .
Exactly .
Mhm .
Well , I guess we just need to find out who we need to get a hold of these -- you know , since we got all the answers for this .
Right .
Right .
We should just call the --
And have 'em just change that because --
Right .
And just tell 'em that you think that --
-- it 's wrong .
They need to change their rules .
Because if women were running everything things would run a lot better !
God ! Would n't it be though ?
But I do n't think they 've really had too many strikes where they 've struck , you know , +struck -- the athletes have s - gone on struck , but ...
No, just baseball I think .
Every n- -- yeah , every ...
I do n't remember anything other than baseball .
Yeah , the baseball and --
Do you know ?
-- and , uh , you know , I know that -- like the act- -- the actors --
Right .
The actors have done it .
-- you know , they 've gone on strike and --
The actors have done it before .
-- and , you know , they do that kind of on a regular basis .
But then they usually do n't last too long .
But I guess , like you say , I think the -- the baseball is the only one that 's really actually gone on strike .
And , of course , they went on strike , if I remember rightly , right at the --
Right at the beginning of the season .
-- at the ... yeah , right .
Right when they were --
And so all the men were really crabby !
Right .
Right .
Right .
When everybody was really unhappy .
So ...
Oh , definitely .
It makes it -- you know , they -- they got -- definitely got you over a barrel .
That 's for sure .
Without any doubt they definitely --
That 's for sure .
Yep.
So , I -- I -- I do n't know what else to say about it other than that I think its wrong , you know ?
It is wrong .
It is .
So , we have to talk longer because it 's not ten minutes yet .
We have to go to ten minutes ?
