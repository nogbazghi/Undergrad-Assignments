Dick Cheney spoke to a conference of the Veterans of Foreign Wars today .
It was the start of yet another series of speeches to bolster The War Against Terror ( TWAT ) , and it must have annoyed him to be forced by events to have to devote several seconds to the issue of the treatment of wounded soldiers .
Later in the day , he himself was treated for a blood clot contracted during long hours of sitting on airplanes in the service of his country .
He was put on blood thinners .
Or possibly that was a metaphor of some kind .
On reading the speech , I can report that the trend towards slightly greater realism some detected in Bush administration officialsâ  speeches after the release of the Iraq Study Group report has now completely reversed itself .
There is no longer any hint that Iraq might be in a civil war or that there exist such creatures as Sunnis or Shiites .
Itâs back to terrorists and Al Qaida and âThey hate us , they hate our country , they hate the liberties for which we stand .
They want to destroy our way of life , so that freedom no longer has a home and defender in the world .â 
Because freedom is American , dammit .
If it shows up in any other country , itâs just visiting .
And on those visits , it so often seems to come down with deep venous thrombosis .
Cheney said he hopes that , unlike the vote on the non-binding resolution , when Congress votes on âemergencyâ  funding for the war , sorry , âfor the troops ,â  â I sincerely hope the discussion this time will be about winning in Iraq , not about posturing on Capitol Hill .â 
He concluded , âItâs a messy , dangerous world , made better by the active , committed presence of the United States .â 
Messy and dangerous .
He makes it sound like someone left their skates on the stairs again â  and weâre looking at you , Iran !
