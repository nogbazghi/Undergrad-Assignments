Another volume of Initial D. People who have seen Takumi race have been wondering for a while if he can pull his magic off on a mountain other than his normal Akina run ; we finally discover the answer .
No, I wo n't tell you what it is .
Cole has the chance to take his relationship to the next level , will he do it ?
And finally , summer 's over and school begins , will this mean that Tak 's racing will be put on hold ?
<p>This is a good volume .
You really get to see some great racing scenes , it 's definately worth the ten bucks you need to pay for it .
If you 've read the other five volumes and liked them , I 'm betting that you 'll like this one , too .
If you have n't read the earlier parts or you did n't like them , then do n't buy this quite yet .
The character designs can be a little weird at times , but it really is n't that bad , they grow on you .
You 'll get used to it , and hopefully it wo n't get in the way of your enjoying a good story .
