Right .
And let 's see , where my mom is in Venice there are Cubans , El Salvadorians , um , Guatemalans , Filipinos , um people from Iraq and Iran .
All kinds of people .
Mhm .
All kind -- people from the islands .
There 's a l- big variety of people .
Hm .
So , how does that affect , um , I guess affirmative action ?
Are you required to , um , just have a percentage of minority groups ?
No, I just , ah -- I like a variety of people .
Ah , I do n't work -- have a company .
I do n't --
Oh .
-- work for -- I do n't own a business at all and , ah , it -- the way I feel about it is I -- I 'm sure that there 's people in the past particularly , who were hired to fill a quota --
Mhm .
-- but -- and if you look at the big picture --
Mhm .
-- like -- like the big picture of the United States and the people who are Afro American we - were descended from slaves --
Mhm .
-- um , that unless you continually churn people and have an upwardly mobile that -- where it 's possible to -- to go up economically --
Mhm .
-- if you do n't create a way for people to rise , you 're going to have , um --
-- people with no stake in the United States at all .
No -- they 'll be disenfranchised , they 'll be disgruntled .
They wo n't have a investment in this country and they wo n't be participating .
They 'll be stuck down in the bottom and it 's easy , especially if you live in a big city , if you get broke anybody is -- a lot of people down here are riding around in big cars , big SUVs r- -- wearing new clothes , riding around looking like , um , they 're doing very well and that --
-- stuff is not paid for .
You know ?
So , you feel -- so , you feel that affirmative action is the means of providing opportunities for people that otherwise would n't have them ?
Y - yeah and it 's artificial , it was created legislatively , it 's -- yeah , because um in -- especially in LA or any big city , you go up , you go down .
You can go up , you can go down and you 're -- um , I work -- I did some volunteer work in a homeless shelter --
Mhm .
-- Salvation Army with women and my deal was I was going to , um , school in Burbank to be a make up artist and I needed to practice --
Mhm .
I practiced on my own , I prac - -- I did n't do anything but that class and I just practiced , practiced , practiced until it was second nature --
Mhm .
I could work on anybody 's face who would sit still --
Mhm .
-- and I got these -- um , I would call -- call around these different shelters for -- ah , people do n't have any housing --
