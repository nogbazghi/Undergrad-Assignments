I purchased this steam cleaner after doing tons of research and reading other reviews and I bought a winner !
I had heard great things about the shark mop but seemed very flimsy to me .
The Steam Fast is very light and is easy for me to use even though I have herniated discs .
It is very solid and well built also .
What impressed me the most however , is how it cleans !
I have green grout lines that looked black and after cleaning them , I was truly amazed by how much dirt came off !
My friend came over after I cleaned my white tile floor and thought I had put a new floor in !
I was also impressed by how well it cleaned my bathroom .
I ca n't say enough about what a great machine this is !
