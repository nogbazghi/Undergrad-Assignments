To me , the scariest stories are not the typical horror stories involving ghosts , vampires or serial killers .
Far more frightening are the tales that could actually happen : tales of environmental or military disaster .
That is why Kyle Mills 's novel Darkness Falls is scarier than anything that Stephen King could put out .
Darkness Falls features the return of series character Mark Beamon after a couple standalone books .
Beamon is a former bend-or-break-the-rules FBI agent who is now a bend-or-break-the-rules agent for Homeland Security , particularly the branch that handles Energy Security .
When a Saudi oil field starts developing problems , Beamon investigates and drafts environmentalist Erin Neal to assist .
Neal realizes that there is a bacteria in the oil deposit that is consuming the supply and threatens the entire field .
With a second similar infection in an Alaskan oil field , it becomes quickly apparent that this is no natural event .
Neal has been a recluse since the death of his ex-girlfriend , though he soon realizes that reports of her passing were not true .
This realization comes when Neal recognizes the bacteria as a variation on one he designed ( to clean up oil spills ) , and that only she knew the design also .
Unfortunately , the government also catches on , and rashly decides that Neal is a terrorist and suddenly Constitutional rights go out the door .
Only Beamon suspects that Neal is innocent , and meanwhile the real culprit is planning something far more sinister .
Mills does a good job at portraying a United States that is crippled by a major oil crisis that threatens the stability of almost all civilization .
But then again , Mills usually does a good job with his stories .
If you like a good , truly scary ( because it could happen ) story , Darkness Falls is a recommended read .
