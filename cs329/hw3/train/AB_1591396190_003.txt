Blue Ocean Strategy by W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne is not the breeziest read but it has some very interesting points for business owners .
Even if you do n't have your own business , Blue Ocean Strategy 's creative recommendations are useful to stretch and challenge your current thinking .
Rather than fighting your competitors ( i .e . , the red ocean strategy because it 's a bloody battle ) can you make your competition irrelevant ( i .e . , the blue ocean strategy where you swim alone ) ?
What parts of the business can you reduce or eliminate ?
Can you sell to different customers ?
What can you create that is new ?
These are just some of the many challenging questions that Kim and Mauborgne raise .
They also provide many interesting examples from Cirque du Soleil to [yellow tail ] wines to the NYPD turnaround under Bill Bratton 's leadership .
There is a lot of juicy material in this book .
My one quibble is that it 's not the most accessible read .
There is a lot of information , lots of theory , lots of graphs .
I read a lot of business books , and I had a hard time keeping track of everything -- sometimes I felt there was too much and I would have liked to cover few topics but more in-depth .
Still , if Blue Ocean Strategy can cause you to question just one part of your business ( or your life ) then it is a worthwhile read .
