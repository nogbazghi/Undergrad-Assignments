The premise of the book is quite interesting : A guy disappearing 10 years ago and calling each mother 's day .
As the story unfolds , there is very little police insights or technical details besides some explanations on tower tracking of a bunch of pre-paid phones around the big apple .
I felt the story deserved more research and details .
