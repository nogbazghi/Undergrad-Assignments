My dad finally got a car vacuum he did n't want to return .
For such a little vacuum it operates like a large house vacuum .
My dad was really impressed .
The various tiny crevice tool attachments lets you detail your car like the pros .
The hoses is flexible enough that it wo n't crack or break so quickly .
The only thing that I found as a disadvantage is it could really use a holder for all the attachments for the amount you 're paying for the unit .
