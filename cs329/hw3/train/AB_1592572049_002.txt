This book had me .
This thing kept me up late .
While reading this I felt like the events were unfolding anew to me .
When Hitler took control of Europe I felt like I was living it .
When Pearl Harbor was bombed I felt like it just happened .
The retaking of Europe and the invention and use of the atomic bomb all felt like they were current events .
This book gives the perfect overview of such a gigantic subject .
Everyone should learn about this .
Going into this book I knew little of the subject besides the few key events like Pearl Harbor , D-Day , Hiroshima , Hitler , but after reading this book I can realize a larger whole and where these events fit and many more things that went on .
Also the book begins with a brief overview of World War One , which is essential to know in order to understand World War Two .
I cannot believe what happened in this war and in this modern age .
The only complaints I have are that because it 's an Idiot 's Guide book the tone is sometimes a little too comfortable with the little side notes and anecdotes , but still the author does a good job of not letting the tone get too too casual .
The one other thing is that I wish that it had better maps .
There are a small number mixed into the chapters , but they are not too detailed .
I found myself consulting my own maps .
All that aside , for anyone who has no clue about this war and what all went into it will find this the perfect start .
