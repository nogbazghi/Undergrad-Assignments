Prostate problems ?
Start here !
This book covers it all , from prostate cancer to beneign .
It even covers prostate congestion - a subject other books seem to ignore .
This book , plus my urologist [he recommended the book ] helped me with my problem which after all the testing came back negative , turned out to be prostate congestion .
Please read the book for solutions , advice etc .
A must read which could save you a lot of discomfort or even pain .
