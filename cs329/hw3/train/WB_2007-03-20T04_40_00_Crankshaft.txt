I do n't understand why Americans allow their government to continue this illegal invasion .
I 'm Malaysian and everyday I witness the fervent anti-American sentiment increasing .
Most Americans I know are incredible people and I do n't want anything bad to happen to them .
Is It Really A War Against Terror ?
