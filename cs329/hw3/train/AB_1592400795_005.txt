This book is clear-headed , chock full of invaluable tell-it-like-it-is insights , humorous or serious when it needs to be .
If you want coddling go elsewhere .
If you want to hear the truth about what it takes to get ahead in business and in life -- manners , smarts , listen to your own instincts , think in the long term -- you 'll have to agree that the little stuff DOES matter most , and Brillstein 's career and accumulated respect shows it .
As the jacket says : like having your own personal manager without having to part with 15 % of your paycheck .
That 's worth the price of the book right there .
( And it 's small enough to carry everywhere ! )
