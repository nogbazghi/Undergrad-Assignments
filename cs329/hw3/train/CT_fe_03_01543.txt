-- and all those guys but , you know , I just -- I just do n't see it -- I ca n't even -- I ca n't even fat- -- you know , in my head imagine that kind of money in a checking account .
I -- I think -- I think the country will get tired of them .
Because -- you know , and then they do n't just get the salaries , they get all the --
Mhm .
-- the perks , the baseball cards --
Mhm , right .

Yeah , yeah .
And , um , eventually people --
Even women , even women .
Yeah , mhm .
People will get tired of it and , um , it wo n't become so -- as important to 'em and , uh , so ...

Yeah .
Well , the -- you know , the -- the like , " Well , if I do n't get this " um , they throw a tantrum and do n't play .
Mhm .
And that 's -- and that 's what it looks like -- I 'm sure to a child , you know , I mean how can you cancel the World Series .
Right .
You know --
Right .

Mhm .
It 's --
This is something we watched when , uh , in school even when I was growing up , we watched the World Series and --
Well , sure .
