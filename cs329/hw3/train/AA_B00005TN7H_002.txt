It is so easy to seal items in a wide mouth jar with this sealer .
Just fill the jar up , place a canning lid on top , place the sealer on top and use your seal-o-meal or food saver to get all the air out .
It makes things like chocolate chips , raisans , nuts etc . last so much longer .
You can even pop open the lid , get out what you need and reseal it with the same lid for a longer shelf life !
