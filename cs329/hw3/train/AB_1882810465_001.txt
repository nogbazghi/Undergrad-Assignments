D-Day is often presented in books , films and other media as a two-dimensional episode between Germans and Americans .
In this refreshing volume , the significant roles of the British and Canadian--and even the French--forces are described along with those of the Americans , and the role of Ukrainians , old men , and boys forced into uniform is covered along with that of the Germans .
<p>At the core of this concise , comprehensive overview of Operation Overlord--the Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6 , 1944--are chapters that provide detailed , minute-by-minute and hour-by-hour descriptions of the action on each of the five Allied beachheads .
Sections on weapons and equipment , Allied and Axis leaders , aircraft and airborne operations , and other salient topics help to add depth and detail to these accounts .
Brief but detailed introductions and conclusions clearly establish the context of the invasion and describe its effects .
<p>Came across this book after reading another by the same author , a volume on the Korean War titled " Fire &Ice . "
Was pleased with it , so decided to give this one a chance .
Very pleased that I did .
