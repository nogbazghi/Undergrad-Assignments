I LOVE Linda Howard books .
I have n't read a book by her that I have n't liked , and boy can she write an alpha male .
Her stories are rich , full of emotion and she really connects to the reader .
This story in particular was so well written , you feel the struggles of both Dane and Marlie and when the end of the book comes , LH rewards the readers with a great HEA.
I am really looking forward to reading her MacKenzie family .
