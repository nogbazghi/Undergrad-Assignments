When I first started using the 05518 Hamilton Beach Cool mist humidifier with these filters I went through several a season .
They would get moldy and start to smell bad after a few weeks , as several other reviewers mention .
It could last a little longer if I ran it all the time .
However , last winter I found a site recommending the use of a Bacteriostatic water treatment with any cool mist humidifier .
I got some from RPS products and it is amazing !
You really must use this stuff in any cool mist humidifier .
With it , one filter lasted the whole season without a problem .
RPS also make generic filters for this humidifier that seem to work just as well and are slightly cheaper .
With the solution , 05518 is a great humidifier .
I like it better than many other humidifiers I 've tried because it has several modes including a quiet mode that is very quiet .
It also has a digital measure of the humidity so you can set it in 1 % increments .
Many other humidifiers only give you a few levels of humidity to choose from .
I also lost a part for the humidifier once ; I dropped the cap and I lost the spring that keeps the valve closed .
I called Hamilton Beach and they were helped me find the part I needed and helped me order a new one .
With whatever humidifier you get , make sure if you get a cool mister , get the bacteriostatic solution !
