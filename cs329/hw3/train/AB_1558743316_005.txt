I expected the 2nd Helping to be more of the first--a good , light , uplifting book that I could give to anyone for Christmas or if they wre having a hard time .
I got the 2nd helping and found it to be depressing and full of backhanded insults .
Full of stories of parents who go to extraordinary lengths for their children , I think it might make less self-extending parents feel guilty for not doing such things .
Yet everyday , ordinary parenting--and even living honestly and with integrity--is quite an accomplishment .
