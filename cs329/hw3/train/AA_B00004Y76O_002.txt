There is n't that much exciting stuff to say about vacuum bags , but these are well engineered and even have a nice little flap that seals the hole so dust does n't escape after you take the bag out of the vacuum .
I highly recommend using bags with this vacuum as it allows you to suck up a lot more dust between emptying , and saves wear and tear on the HEPA filter .
These seem to last a long time and hold a lot of sawdust or drywall dust .
