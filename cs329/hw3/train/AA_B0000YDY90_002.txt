I have a number of Vornado humidifiers in my home .
With two toddler twin daughters , keeping the air as free of bacteria is important to me .
This product seems to be doing a very good job .
I have noticed an improvement in the wicks that draw up the water : no signs of bacterial aging .
While I am not a biologist , nor have run any scientific tests , it seems to work with no side effects .
The supplier promptly shipped the water treatment as described .
There was no communications , as none was necesary .
The purchase just went through as it should , with no hitches .
I will buy this product again .
