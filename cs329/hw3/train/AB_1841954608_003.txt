This book won the Booker prize in 2003 , and I 've wanted to read it ever since .
However , I found the story frustrating rather than funny because , really , how many bad decisions can a teenager make ?
This is not one of those books where the journey is better than the destination .
In fact , you have to endure the journey to earn the destination--a very satisfying ending with a message .
Plus , the events and characters are completely outrageous--caricatures almost--even for Texas/Texans .
I continually had to remind myself that a story does not have to be believable to be worthwhile .
