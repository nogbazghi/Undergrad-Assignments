alienationists
The context in which I have seen this is a slur against Marxists or about people who do n't vote ( in general , people who do n't just go along with the existing power/economic paradigm ) .
I ca n't imagine that Jenna is thinking about such matters tho .
Maybe it means people who do n't love America .
