The book contains a reasonable number of recipes and lots of 'hints ' that if you 've done ANY reading about low carbohydrate eating , will be superfluous .
The recipes run the gamut of carb counts , though I thought that the bulk of them were much higher carb than is helpful .
Following the suggestions in this book and the recipes , it would n't be all that hard to hit 80-100++ grams of carb per day ... which is simply TOO HIGH for many people who are following low carb lifestyles .
Many recipes call for sugar , white flour , semi-sweet chocolate and cornstarch .
Come ON... those are NOT "low carb " ingredients .
This is more or less a repackaged low fat/lower cal cookbook with "low carb " thrown on the cover to try to generate some market share .
My copy is being donated to a charity , it is n't worth the space on the shelf for someone interested in real "low carb " cooking .
