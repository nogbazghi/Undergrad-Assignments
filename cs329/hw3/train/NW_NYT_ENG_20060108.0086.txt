A bit of a cloud may have preceded
Erskine Bowles ' selection as president of the University of North
Carolina system -- there was an illegally closed meeting in
the course of the process -- but Bowles has acted
quickly and properly to put the issue to rest .
In an agreement reached with The News &amp; Observer and other
news organizations interested in open meetings ( and suing to ensure
them ) , the new president sounds a vow for openness .
And let 's hope he 's sent an important message to his staff
in Chapel Hill and to the chancellors of the 16
constituent campuses that doing the public 's business in public will
be a priority in the Bowles administration .
The meeting in question took place in September as the Board
of Governors ' presidential search committee was holding final discussions with
Bowles as the likely replacement for Molly Broad .
The committee
relied on a questionable legal opinion that said it could
adjourn a closed meeting and , without letting the public know ,
reconvene it a few weeks later .
That sort of maneuver clumsily short-circuits the intent of the Open
Meetings Law , which is to keep the public in the
know about when and where public business will be discussed .
Bowles says that wo n't happen again .
He also says he will
ask legislators to withdraw an ill-conceived bill , introduced during Broad 's
tenure , that would shield certain university records from public view .
The state dodged a lawsuit with the UNC settlement .
Meanwhile , North
Carolina gained a clear , powerful voice for open government early
in Bowles ' presidency .
