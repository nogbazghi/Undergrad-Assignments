I had been searching for this book for a while , so when I finally acquired it , I was looking forward to making the re-acquaintance with this accessory .
On reading the guide more thoroughly I was both impressed and disappointed .
Impressed by the comprehensive history , more comprehensive barding coverage , addition of detail , and expansion of the often dubious area of spear/pikes & damage they inflict .
However , once the euphoria of looking in these areas and descriptions of weapons and arms , the document disappointed as a whole .
It had little that would add practical elements to adventuring , and would probably only stand one or two thorough reads , weapon summary excluded , and that alone does not make for a lasting document .
A great idea , but could have been advanced further then it has been in this production .
