i think this is just another marketing ploy to make you pay more for an item . it says replace filter every 3 months - you will get an indicator light letting you know when to replace , and you will clearly see so on a filter - it will be dirty .
WELL , neither happened yet , and its 9 months into heavy use on 2 different HEPA vaccuum cleaners .
i bought extras in advance thinking ill need them , but SAVE YOUR MONEY ! ! ! ! !
