The National Governorâs Association , which is the union the governors belong to , or something , is meeting in Washington , so I guess they have to put up with George Bush crashing their party , and laugh at his jokes , no matter how lame : âAnd we welcome the governors and the spouses .
We welcome governors without their spouses .
( Laughter . )â  
Bush was on his very best behaviour .
He did nât throw his own feces , and even remembered to say ic : âIâve had some good meetings with the Democrat -- Democratic leadership .â 
He wishes he did nât have to work with the states , or something : â I think about making sure that Homeland Security and our states work closely together .
I wish that was nât the way it was .
But it is .â 
Or was .
He told the governors about all the shit he likes : â I like to say weâre in an ideological war that âs going to last a while .â 
â I like to remind people that if we leave Iraq before the job is done , the enemy will follow us here .â 
âThe thing I like most about the law [ No Child Left Behind ] is that when we find a youngster who is struggling with reading , that we provide extra help to make sure he or she gets up to speed early , before itâs too late .â 
Thatâs the second time Iâve heard him use that âbefore itâs too lateâ  line recently , which not only suggests that some children will be left behind , because itâs âtoo lateâ  for them , but is an insult to everyone in an adult literacy program , or indeed anyone who continues to educate themselves throughout their lifetime .
But then your understanding of learning must be pretty impoverished if you think it can be reduced to a number : â I donât see how you can fix a problem unless you measure the problem .â 
Not that even he canât occasionally learn a new word : âAnother exciting technological breakthrough is going to come with cellulosic ethanol .
Itâs a long , fancy word for making gasoline -- or making ethanol out of product other than sugar and corn , like switchgrass or wood chips .â 
Actually , itâs two words , but thanks for playing .
