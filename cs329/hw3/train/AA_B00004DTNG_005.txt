This product is a typical , yet usable , B&D design .
The handle-mounted power cord lock is somewhat difficult to use , but works fairly well after the cord is "locked " into a type of holder that could be improved .
The product does what it is intended to do , no more , no less .
It is a powerful vacuum and works very well with high amounts of dry leaf material .
The attached bagger is somewhat cumbersome to use and empty , produces copious amounts of leaf-dust , but overall , this product works quite well in vacuuming lots of leaf and yard material .
