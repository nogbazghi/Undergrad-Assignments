As the talks with North Korea are on the verge of breakdown , US chief negotiator Christopher Hill comments , âThe day Iâm able to explain to you North Korean thinking is probably the day Iâve been in this process too long .â 
Thatâs actual Bush administration policy , you know : on the actual day you finally master the skills necessary to do your job competently , they fire you .
Which brings us to the US attorneys , specifically a WaPo editorial telling everyone to just calm down , to let go of the âstubbornness and overheated rhetoric on both sides ,â  which âthreaten an unnecessary constitutional crisis that would only bog down the inquiry in a distracting fight over process .â 
I really dislike these lazy editorials that come up during every scandal â  or âsupposed scandal , â  as the editorial calls this one â  accusing both sides of being equally unreasonable .
Itâs the editorial equivalent of a Joe Lieberman âoh everybody in Washington ( except me ) is just so unreasonable and partisanâ  speech .
The authors could write them in their sleep , and most likely do .
You know thereâs something seriously wrong with it when the piece characterizes Bushâs take-it-or-fuck-off offer as âAlberto R. Gonzales would set the record straight in new hearings ...â  Yeah , Gonzales ... record ... straight ...
The Post suggests that Gonzales and other Justice Dept officials testify first and then , only âif questions remainâ  should Karl Rove and Harriet Miers be interviewed .
Of course , any familiarity with the facts makes it clear that the decision to fire the attorneys was made in the White House rather than the Justice Dept , that Gonzales has never made a big decision by himself in his whole career , so it is clearly impossible for Gonzo and the Gonzettes not to leave questions remaining ( which is why Iâve sadly had to forgo calling this scandal GonzoGate ) .
The WaPo thinks Rove and Miers should testify on the record but neednât do so under oath because itâs already illegal to lie to Congress .
If it really makes no difference either way , thereâs no reason not to swear them in .
Makes you wonder why anyone is ever sworn in .
( Iâm not sure what the legal difference is , possibly that the oath to tell the whole truth is a higher standard , that the statute against lying to Congress does nât cover lies by omission . )
The Post thinks Bush should accept its eminently reasonable recommendations : âIf Mr. Bush is serious about wanting the truth to come out , he will relent on this issue .â 
You know someoneâs been in the editorial-writing business too long if they can write , without laughing uproariously for hours , the phrase âIf Mr. Bush is serious about wanting the truth to come out ...â 
Elsewhere in the paper , the WaPo reports on political interference in the government lawsuit against the tobacco companies .
But what you never hear much about is the policy , dating from Ashcroft , of Justice systematically ordering US attorneys to demand the death penalty in cases where they did nât think it warranted , as part of a policy to spread the federal death penalty evenly over the country , imposing it on non-death-penalty states , in other words overriding the prosecutors because of policy rather than the facts of the individual cases .
I know of no case in the last 6 years that went the other direction , with a US attorney who wanted to seek the death penalty ordered not to .
