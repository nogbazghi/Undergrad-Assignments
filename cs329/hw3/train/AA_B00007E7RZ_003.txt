Is there anywhere to buy the old filters without the blue wrapping .
I have used Honeywell Humidifiers for many years and never had the smell / mold problem you do with these filters , they are downright unhealthy .
I tried to rate these zero stars they are that bad but the system would not let me .
Please go back to the old filters
