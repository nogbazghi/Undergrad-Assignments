Was so excited to finally have a real mixer !
And it has been wonderful , I really have loved it for mixing .
After the first year the black knob on the front just split apart and fell off !
We have now owned our mixer for about 4 years , light use only .
Last month the beaters quit running , I would guess the gears are plastic and stripped .
Not sure what to do now ?
Maybe they are all made with plastic parts inside , or maybe the artisan is a better built machine ?
I 'm sold on stand mixers , just not on kitchen aid !
