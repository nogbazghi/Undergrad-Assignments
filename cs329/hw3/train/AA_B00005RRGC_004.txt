First : If you 're interested in this product , I got mine at Wal-mart at an end of season sale for $ 50 .
Typically they 're about $ 79 there .
Secondly , this is a great product .
I love that it has casters which make it easily portable , and its incredibly light without water in it ....so light my three year old can pick it up .
The side tanks are easily filled , though once you 've done so they do become quite heavy , of course .
I have had mine about one year and purchased it for a small 950 sq ft apt .
We ran it for the course of a long , very cold winter and the accuset feature was wonderful .
I did n't have to keep running over to turn it on and off as the humidity fell .
It was the first winter of my 26 that I did not go through about 20 bottles of lotion and 15 bottles of Carmax .
There are several small issues to be highlighted , though really of no consequence : ( 1 ) the tanks are very heavy once filled with water and thus the trips from the bathtub are best done by someone WITHOUT a slipped disc , ( 2 ) while we quickly grew accustomed to the white noise , the unit is a tad loud , to the point that we actually had to turn our television and radio volume up louder than normal , ( 3 ) the rooms closest to the vicinity of the console are the best humidified while those farther away seem lacking - but thats to be expected , ( 4 ) replacement filters have to be ordered online direct from the company as the production of this unit has been discontinued - for me , a minor hassle .
All in all , I love my unit during the winter and would n't give it up .
I absolutely recommend it .
