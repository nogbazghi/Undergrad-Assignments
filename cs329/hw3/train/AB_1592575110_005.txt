I skimmed this book in a bookstore and thought it would be a great volume to inform me for debating current political issues with better regard to their historical foundations .
I bought the book on Amazon and upon reading it , I was disappointed in the author 's leftist slant .
He blames most world problems on the United States in any spurious way he can derive .<p>There
are some useful facts here , but read this book with a grain of salt if you have it , or buy a better book if you do not .
It is one thing to take a position and justify it , like Jared Diamond in " Guns , Germs and Steel" , an excellent book , though I disagree with his premises .
It is another thing to do as Strauss does in this book and lbindly take a slant , possibly even unaware of the slant , and meander through a supposedly historical acocunt whilst rewriting it to suit your tastes .<p> I
wish there was more consistency in the quality of " Complete Idiot 's guide to.. . " books .
