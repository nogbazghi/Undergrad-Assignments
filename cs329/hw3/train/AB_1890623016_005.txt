Everyone , it seems , has heard of Hannibal bringing his army ,including the elephants ,through the Alps , right to the doorstep of Rome .
However , a readable account of Carthage vs. Rome is not easy to find .
I 've been very happy to find this fascinating historical novel as the best way to teach my two sons , ages 11 and 14 , about this time in history .
There are some valuable lessons for us all in the book--valor , honor , and how corruption destroys great nations .
