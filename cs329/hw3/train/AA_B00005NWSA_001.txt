I looked at all of the machines listed on Amazon .
I read the reviews .
The Waring appeared to be the best though I worried a bit about the pretty plastic motor cover .
It almost fakes chrome steel , and now I know why !
I use hard frozen ice cream and like my malts thick .
My machine may be "faulty " but it overheated and quit the third time I used it .
The Amazon vendor is a pain in the six and Waring 's talking machine recorded my message ( to call back ) around an hour ago .
I 'm looking for a commercial grade machine !
