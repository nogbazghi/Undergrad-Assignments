Stephen Lawhead 's Scarlet represents the third of his works in a row that I have thoroughly enjoyed .
This , the second in the trilogy that 're-imagines ' the legend of Robin Hood , transporting the benefactor of the poor to Wales , loses nothing in the translation .
Scarlet centers itself on the imprisoned Will Scarlet who dictates his tale to the Monk Odo , whom he has befriended in his five months of captivity .
Will recounts to the Monk how , after losing everything , seeks out Rhi Bran y Hud , the fabled ' King Raven' who steals from the rich to give to the poor , and seeks vengeance on those who stole his land and rightful kingdom from him .
Scarlet is taken in by Bran and his 'merry ' men and women , and immediately takes up their cause to bring justice to the displaced citizens of Elfael , and restore the land and the throne to Bran himself .
Another wonderful entry in a truly inspired re-imagining of a popular tale , author Lawhead has scored again .
I eagerly await the final chapter in this trilogy , Tuck , which has been released this year .
