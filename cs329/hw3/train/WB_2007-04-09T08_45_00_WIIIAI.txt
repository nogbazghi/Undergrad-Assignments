John McCain on 60 Minutes conceded that the majority in the US opposes the Iraq war but said , â I disagree with what the majority of the American people want .â 
He was not asked why , then , the majority of the American people would want to vote for him .
Iâd actually be interested to hear how heâd answer that one .
He also acknowledged the heavy security for his trip to the market , but said , â I can tell you that if it had been two months ago and Iâd asked to do it , they would have said , â Under no circumstances whatsoever .â 
I view that as a sign of progress .â 
Or a sign that they no longer care whether he lives or dies .
Wait a minute .
Why does the âkevlarâ  in this vest smell exactly like Velveeta ?
( I just spent two minutes trying to decide whether Velveeta was more or less comical than Cheez Whiz , and Iâm still just not sure .
This is another of those choices which confront the owner of a blog every single day .
It is not for the faint of heart . )
