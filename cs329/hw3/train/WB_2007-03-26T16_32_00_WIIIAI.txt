Alberto Gonzalesâs senior counsel Monica Goodling will refuse to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Goodling took a leave of absence earlier this month .
Whether that âs paid or unpaid I donât know .
It should be paid since sheâs doing the same job , ensuring that the truth is not told to Congress , that she did before going on leave .
Okay , regular readers will have figured out right away that the reason Iâm writing about this is because I want to point out that if there was ever a perfect name for an employee for the Department of Justice ( she used to be its spokesmodel , too ) , it is Monica Goodling .
The Justice Dept websiteâs front page currently shows Gonzales putting a , ah , er , good face on things ( click to enlarge , if you dare ) .
See , that âs what he and the US attorneys should be doing , is the message here , combating the sexual abuse and exploitation of children in Colorado .
Troy Eid is not as justice departmenty a name as Monica Goodling , but it is Die Yort spelled backwards , for whatever that âs worth .
