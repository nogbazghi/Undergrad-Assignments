I bought the Cuisinart Immersion blender a year and a half ago , and used it 2-3 times a week with passable ( if noisy and slighly lumpy ) results , until it died last week .
I was pleased with my Cuisnart until I replaced it with the KitchenAid Immersion blender .
This thing ROCKS.
It 's quieter , twice as powerful ( check the amps ! ) , has nine speeds AND a detachable blade arm for easy , submersable , cleanup .
Best of all , it leaves no lumps .
You can taste the difference !
