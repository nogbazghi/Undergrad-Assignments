Amazing book .
Excellent photography of both the more commom angels and the rarer , difficult or impossible to find in a LFS , ones .
Basic info on fish and aquarium husbandry , not a fault , IMO , as most people with special interest on angels may already have aquariuns for some time and read other general set-up and maintance books .
Well worth the money .
