I owned a Braun Miniprimer Plus Hand Blender , with variable speeds and broad stainless steel housing for the blades .
I had it for years and worked great until the motor finally gave up , but it 's no longer available .
I purchased the Cuisinart CSB-33 QuikPrep Hand Blender .
It is supposed to have two speeds , but really hard to tell the difference and either button needs to be held down very firmly .
I always have to use it at high speed and then takes a long time to completely blend .
So far I have only used it for light liquids such as protein drinks , sometimes containing a cut-up banana .
It ca n't chop any firmer fruits or vegetables .
It also cannot stand .
The flimsy plastic housing for the blades has 3 little knobs on which this top-heavy blender is supposed to stand .
This morning I stood it upright in its two-cup plastic container and it immediately fell over , splashing protein drink everywhere , which then ran under my coffee maker , my very heavy mixer and several cannisters .
I am thankful I was n't trying to blend hot soup on the stove .
If you are n't prepared to lay it on its side when not firmly holding it and the container its in , this blender may not be for you , either .
