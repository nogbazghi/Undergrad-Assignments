Excellent machine for the home .1 hour per tank of water is pretty good .
Warm-up time is a little long , but not too bad .
Lots of brush extras ...but no where to put them ? ! ? Hmmmm... thank God for a shopping bag .
Very portable .
Steam flow is consistent .
Be careful moving the machine while in action because you might get a shot of hot water instead of steam coming out the nozzle .
The first couple of seconds after initial blasting will be water too .
Overall ... great home appliance .
Very good value for the price .
