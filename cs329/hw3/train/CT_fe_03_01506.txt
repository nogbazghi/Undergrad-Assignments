You know .
And so they 're -- they do n't listen to --
-- what 's being said to them .
I think that 's true .
As I get older too , I have more trouble , um , focusing , because I have to kinda think of what I 'm gonna say --
Yeah .
-- because , um , otherwise I forget what the whole topic was !
Yeah , well I usually kinda -- kinda multi task when it comes to that , you 've gotta be listening --
Exactly .
-- and then thinking about what you 're gonna say at the same time .
Exactly .
Yeah .
I know when my kids were your kids ' age , I -- that 's what -- you know , I knew who closed the door , I was n't in the room --
Mhm .
-- but I knew it .
Mhm .
And I knew who was over there making that noise and I knew somebody was making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich --
Yeah .
-- and all those things .
And my husband could never understand because he --
How you --
-- was n't that way .
Yeah .
He could sit there and tune everybody out --
Yeah .
-- and focus on whatever he wanted to do .
Mhm .
I never have been able to do that .
Yeah , I know what you 're saying .
Have you ?
No. Um , not usually .
You ca n't really distance yourself from --
Uh-uh .
-- the home that you 're supposed to be the h - -- the homemaker or whatever in .
Yeah .
I guess men can -- or for the most part they can disengage because that 's just not their role , I guess , you know ?
Yeah .
Where women , you know , you ca n't just -- you ca n't just turn that part of y- off it when it comes five o'clock or something .
Right .
It just keeps on going and going !
Well , we 've got that brain that --
Yeah .
-- connects , and they 've got the one that 's more one sided .
Yeah , that 's true .
So ...
But --
We 'll just bash men during this conversation --
Oh , the --
-- we wo n't even ...
Oh , let 's not do that .
But -- but it 's true , I mean , they do -- they are able to focus more , um --
Yeah .
-- and tune out stuff .
Yeah .
But , uh ... Well , if we did n't change too much since nine one one , then , um , do we know anybody that did ?
Um ... I do n't think so , I mean , I really [inaudible ] --
I do .
Oh , do you ?
Okay .
My b - -- my brother , who still lives in North Dakota --
Uh-huh .
-- went out and bought two gas masks for he and his wife --
