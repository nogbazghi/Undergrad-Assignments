This is an interesting book I 'd found at the library , and ordered it on Amazon as soon as I could .
It tells four different stories per page , and you have to figure out which story goes where , and when each one starts and ends , and how they 're all connected somehow .
I really like this one more than the children do .
It 's too illogical for most of them .
I find that I can follow the connection between the stories better with each reading .
It is one of my 10 favorite children 's books of all time .
