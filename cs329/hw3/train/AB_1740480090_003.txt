Much more than an atlas , this is a big , ornate cathedral of a book .
I came across Biblica in the reference section of my public library .
I was so taken with the book , I bought two copies to give to my pastor and favorite Bible study teacher .
Written by a team of distinguished academics and Bible scholars , Biblica includes 650 high quality color images of paintings , sculptures and scenic photographs .
There are 125 maps , some of them spanning two full pages , showing prominent locations , journeys , battles , kingdoms and empires discussed in the Bible .
For example , page 167 shows a full page map tracing possible routes the Israelites may have taken on their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land .
The first 89 pages include extensive sections on the development of the Bible , Bible archeology , and the geography and history of Bible lands .
From there the book explains the geography , history , and cultures of the Bible chronologically , every page adorned with stunning artwork , illustrations , maps and photographs .
The back of the book includes informative tables , extensive family trees , a bibliography and glossary .
