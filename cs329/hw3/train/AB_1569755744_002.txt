Please be aware of the word "handbook" .
This "book " was small--about 5x7 size .
In searching for a reference to assist me in recording in my food diary , I thought this would do so .
The foods are listed in five columns--the "food" , the " G I value " , the "amount of food in grams containing 50 grams of carbohydrates " , then " carbohydrate per 100 grams of food " and then the "GL " column--not "one apple " or " 1/3 c of rice " , etc .
So it was not much help to me .
Most text 's that I have viewed so far have GI/GL information for a food serving but it is very limited but this booklet 's listed servings were indescript and not adaptable to everyday life .
The booklet itself was in great condition and it was promptly delivered .
