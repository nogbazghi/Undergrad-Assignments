I have read this book twice .
I will read it again .
Whatever your spiritual belief , whatever your level of faith is or is not , you will be influenced by Rabbi Kula .
His fundemental logical conclusions on what make all humans tick is right down the pike .
The book is not a polyanna fix for all life 's woes but it is sound advice on how to improve your life and improve the lives of the ones around you .
You will cherish the read and you will recommend to others ..... you ca n't not !
