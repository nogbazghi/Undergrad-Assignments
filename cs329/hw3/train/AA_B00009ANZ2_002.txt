Corning Creations is the "bomb" ! ! ! ! !
No matter what you put in them , no matter how baked on ...it comes right off .
You can soak it if you like ...for a couple of seconds , but it is totally NOT necessary !
I 'm just unhappy that I cannot find them anywhere but here and Kohls .
They even have a new line of funky colors according to the Corningware site , but who knows where they can be located .
I 'm telling you , Corning Creations is the best thing they ever came up with and I just do n't think a lot of people know how easy the clean up is .
They are nice and heavy too ...sort of like some type of stone or something .
Do yourself a favor and just buy one piece to try it out , but at the low prices you should just buy a set !
