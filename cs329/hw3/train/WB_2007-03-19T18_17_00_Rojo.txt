" If your war is being won ,
clap your hands !
If your war is being won ,
clap your hands !
Oh , if your war is being won ,
and evil 's on the run ,
if your war is being won ,
clap your hands !
If Gonzo 's staying on ,
clap your hands !
If Gonzo 's staying on ,
clap your hands !
If Gonzo 's staying on ,
'cuz he 's a loyal son ,
if Gonzo 's staying on ,
clap your hands !
If God approves of you ,
clap your hands !
If God approves of you ,
clap your hands !
If God approves of you ,
when you smite who he tells you to ,
If God approves of you ,
clap your hands ! "
