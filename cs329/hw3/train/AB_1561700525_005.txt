I highly recommend this audio tape to people who are trying to incorporate meditation into their lives .
Dr. Borysenko has a very soothing voice and the exercises are effective .
I think this tape may be especially appealing to women ; there is some content that I know some men may find corny .
However , I found the both the breathing exercises and the stretching to be relaxing and very beneficial .
