This mixer was a welcome change from my old , weak-motored mixer .
It is true that the lowest speed is still pretty darn fast .
I was able to mix thick chocolate chip cookie dough on the lowest speed .
But I also did egg whites and they turned out lovely .
I 've had no problem with the beaters bending , and they are very easy to clean .
