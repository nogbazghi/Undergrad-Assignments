Oh , they make horrendous amounts of money .
Oh , that 's sad .
And they 've charged these people these ungodly amounts for fake wrestling .
Oh , my goodness !
Well , see , I 'm not --
It 's all fluff !
-- I 'm not really into sports at all .
Oh !
So , I do n't -- I do n't -- I do n't follow this stuff , I just read what 's in the paper and if it makes the headlines maybe I 've looked at it .
Um , my husband used to be a professional soccer player , but professional soccer players when my husband was a player --
They did n't -- did n't get anything , yeah .
-- did n't make squat , you know ?
Yeah , they 're making a little bit more money now in certain --
-- certain areas --
Yeah .

And -- and all he got was -- was a hip replacement .
Nob - -- somehow I do n't think that 's compensation !

Oh , Mexico 's lovely .

My husband keeps wanting to go to Rio and I --
Rio is the most beautiful city I have ever seen in my life .
Really ?
It is , it is .
I 'm just afraid of it .
