The great thing about this book is that Peter Dorsen writes with a sense of humor .
You can tell he 's not a traditional , button-down , by-the-book doc.
There 's lots of advice and information , but it 's also fun to read .
This would be a terrific book for women , too , if they want to get to know their over-40 guy better .
I 'm surprised it has n't become a best seller .
