I bought this book for my daughter 's 5th birthday .
She enjoys a variety of art forms in a variety of mediums yet she did not comprehend the fact that singing , dancing , banging on a drum , creating a collage , exploring play dough , creating a block structure , and "writing " are all forms of art .
After reading this multicultural book , she has a better understanding of art .
She now understands that art is more than crayons and paint .
She now has a better understanding of creative expression across children of many cultures .
The book is an "easy read " for parents and teachers yet can foster more in-depth conversations when needed .
I will be sharing this book with my daughters preschool teachers .
