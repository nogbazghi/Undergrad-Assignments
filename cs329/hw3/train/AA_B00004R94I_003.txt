My doctor prescribed a healthier diet for me after my annual checkup came back with a red flag flying .
So , I said goodbye to those sugar cereals and bought my Faberware FDM300 drink mixer as my first step to eating healthier .
Now , every morning I make smoothies containing fresh fruits and yougurt and it works like a charm !
I am very pleased with this product and would not trade it for anything !
It is very easy to clean , fast , and efficent .
