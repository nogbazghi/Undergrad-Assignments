-- not easy , you know !
Yeah .
Well , that 's a hard subject to talk about 'cause it 's so vast , um --
Yeah .
Yeah , well --
You 're not even --
-- it 's like my life is -- has changed since then , but for different reasons , you know !
Yeah .
Yeah .
There -- well , there have been a lot of changes .
Um , we did n't really know anyone there .
Yeah .
I mean , we felt for them and it was a tragic thing and -- and we felt horrible about it but directly affecting our lives , it really has n't much .
Um --
Yeah .
I 'd have to say the same too .
Li- like I said --
-- we 're -- we 're diligent about watching what 's going on around us , but other than that there 's really nothing we can do anyway .
Um ... you know , you rely on your faith to get you through whatever you 're gonna get through and ... if there 's a smallpox e- -- you know , epidemic , well , okay , you know --
Yeah .
-- if we 're supposed to make it through we 're gonna make it through .
Yeah .
If not , we wo n't .
So ...
Yep , yeah .
It -- kinda have to say of the same attitude .
Yeah .
Um --
Mostly -- mostly we 're like you , we try and keep the kids , you know , away from the coverage and all that kind of thing .
Mhm , definitely .
Yeah , that 's a big thing I do n't --
-- watching a lotta that because they just do n't understand and you ca n't -- ca n't explain it to them in a -- in terms they will understand .
Yeah .
[several inaudible words ] .
Yeah .
It 's like [inaudible] .
Well we -- we do have friends in the military unfortunately and we were kinda worried that he 'd be sent over .
Mm .
And , uh , and that kinda thing .
But , I mean , luckily he was n't , but , um --
-- you -- you just never know .
No, you do n't .
And -- and had that happened , you know , we would 've said , you know , " Uncle J.C. is going to protect us and take care of us and .. . " and --
Yeah .
-- you know , that 's all you can do .
But ...
Yeah .
Um --
You know , you just -- you -- you explain to 'em what you have to but --
Yeah .
-- at this age , you know , it 's like , they d- just do n't get it .
Yeah .
I seen it more with my -- my cousins and that who have kids who are like , seven , eight , you know .
Th- --
Mhm .
-- they 're really .
' Cause , I mean , I 've -- I 've heard their kids ask some pretty tough questions , and -- and having to field those , and I kinda count my blessings that I do n't have any !
