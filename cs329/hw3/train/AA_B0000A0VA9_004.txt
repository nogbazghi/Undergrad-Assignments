Its a perfect vacuum for those who want a lighweight vacuum to clean their hardwood floors and stairs .
When sweeping with a broom is not sufficient because particles remain no matter how much you sweep .
This 10 pound vacuum carries ( 11amps ) - that 's ALOT of power which reaches everywhere , picking up dust bunnies , kitty litter and even the light layers of dust .
It also has disposable type - T bags to collect the dirt eliminating the messy canisters that are on many vacuums .
If you have carpets , go with an upright , but for hardwood this is a fantastic value .
I recommend highly .
