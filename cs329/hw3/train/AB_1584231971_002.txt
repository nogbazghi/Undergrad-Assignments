I 've never spent so much time analyzing a photo book .
Each picture occupies me with about five minutes of psychoanalysis , trying to figure out the motives behind each piece of gear or memorabilia in the pictures .
Each studio also confirms my hypothesis : the cleaner the home studio environment/setup , the less that actually gets done .
