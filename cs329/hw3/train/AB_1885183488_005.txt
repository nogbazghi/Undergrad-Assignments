This is not a review , but a warning that early on , the book will lose its credibility .
There is a profile of Harry Truman - one of the late bloomers .
The author ( I assume ) has the years of Harry Trumans presidency wrong .
Bad enough the book tilts to the literary/art crowd ( guess all those failed authors are being hopeful ) , but no one at the publisher caught this .
A problem for those publishing executives that only took english lit courses is that they have ignored the basic facts of history
