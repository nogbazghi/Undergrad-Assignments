In this second installment of the King Raven Trilogy we get our story through the eyes of Will Scarlet who has been captured and imprisoned by the Normans .
Book two is just as good as book one and maybe even better .
Lawhead 's writing is above par as usual and the Will character is very likable and three dimensional .
The story is well paced , entertaining , thought-provoking and it brings you to another land and time but not what I would call a page turner that keeps you up at night .
The end hits you with a power punch and then leaves you dangling on the edge of a cliff .
Book three , " Tuck " has been started and I 'm really glad I waited for all three books to be released before I started this trilogy .
If you enjoy history and a good ole entertaining legend get yourself the King Raven Trilogy .
