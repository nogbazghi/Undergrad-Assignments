You know , she 's like , " Do you realise I have a crash axe right behind me in the cockpit --"
"-- if I wanted to do something ? "
You know .
Yeah , I mean , for a -- a -- exactly , I mean , for pilots and , um , you know people who have to go through it every single day it just -- it must be like , you know , something just -- such a pain I guess to do it , but --
