The fascinating aspect of ancient Mayan astronomical observation creating a universal calendar dating from their time through the modern year 2012 is obviously grist for speculation as that date ( and the end of their anciently calculated time ( or at least an era ) approaches .
John Major Jenkins , according to the package notes , is the author of five previous books including " Maya Cosmogenesis 2012 " and " Galactic Alignment " ( an event with practical effects Jenkins gives no clue to but which astronomers with modern instruments apparently actually predict for 2012 ) but has no obvious other qualifications other than ( apparently ) traveling a lot in non-degree-persueing activities .
He is clearly trying to capitalize on this fascination , but does so very badly indeed .
In over two decades of wide ranging audio-book listening , these three discs covering three and a half hours of tedium are by far the most useless , uninteresting set of discs or tapes I have wasted time and money on .
Jenkins gives precious little practical information and unlocks no " secrets . "
Instead , he repeats about 15 minutes worth of Mayan " creation " myths ( without ever getting to the *creation* part ) over two to three hours , plugs previous books with the implication THEY explain what this book promised to , and having run out of material , falls back on trite breathing relaxation exercises ( tarting them up with references to supposed Mayan " shaman traditions " ) .
When purchasing the book , I thought the publisher 's name , " Sounds True " was clever - unfortunately , after listening to this sad exploitation piece , I 'm inclined to re-read it as " ONL Y *sounds * true , " and would be very skeptical about trying another of their other releases .
Not a good listen ( Jenkins does n't even READ well - lots of curious pauses ) .
Sad .
I usually pass audio books I 'm done with on to friends or the local library - this one just goes in the trash .
