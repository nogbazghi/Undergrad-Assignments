Too bad Hoover 's engineers did not think the overall sweeper product through well in the first place .
This "extension " is obviously an afterthought , and it came too late , so it could not be fitted properly onto the sweeper the way the sweeper was already designed .
This hose REPLACES the existing hose -- it does not just add on to it , so you lose the 2' or so of the original hose that could have been used .
Also , as other reviewers have noted , this hose is not very flexible in terms of stretching out .
It stretches only a little , and any further pulling on it just pulls your sweeper over .
That being said , once you figure out how to use it with the limitations , it is better to have the extra 8' or so that this hose really does give you , than to struggle with the original hose .
( Although , when you use the sweeper as a normal upright , you have to put the original hose back on , or else somehow work around all the extra hose hanging off . )
