Great concept , but in reality it was a bust .
Got one to marinate my foods prior to grilling .
After first HAND WASHING , rubber gasket around rim came out , absolutely NO WAY to get it back in and STAY in .
Refused to create a tight seal .
Used it ONCE.
Thought I had a 'lemon ' so bought a second one .
Worse yet .
This time , rubber gasket 'grew ' and I could not get it to lay in the rim properly no matter what we tried .
FINALLY got it in and began sealing .
machine turned off as if seal was complete .
Turn nob to keep seal tight , remove tubing , seal broken .
Over and over various combinations .
DON" T WASTE YOUR MONEY !
