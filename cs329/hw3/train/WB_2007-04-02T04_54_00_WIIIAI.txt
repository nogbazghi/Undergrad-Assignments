Robert Fisk writes about how the Iranians are using the footage of the 15 British sailors to humiliate the West : âBlair will fulminate and Bush will roar and the Iranians will sit back and enjoy every second of it .â 
This was obvious when they chose to display the one woman captive first .
Bushâs casual ( I assume ) use of the word âhostagesâ  Saturday , by the way , ratcheted up the diplomatic tensions in a way that makes it harder for Iran to back down .
Almost as if he wanted a crisis for some , you know , reason .
Though Fisk points out that Iran understands us much better than we bother to understand Iran and is using this knowledge to manipulate Western reactions , he does nât explain something that âs been bothering me for days : the first letter ostensibly written by captive Faye Turney was obviously written for her by someone with a less than fluid grasp of English .
[Update : here âs an analysis by a linguist . ]
That was pointed out in every story about it , Iran must have been following those stories , but the 2nd and 3rd letter were no better .
They did nât care that the letters werenât even slightly plausible , and Iâm not sure why .
Hereâs the thing about George Bush : you can photoshop him to make him look stupid , like this picture illustrating The Onionâs story âBush Refuses To Set Timetable For Withdrawal Of Head From White House Banister , â 
but you really just cannot make him look stupider than he does naturally ( Reuters , yesterday ) :
