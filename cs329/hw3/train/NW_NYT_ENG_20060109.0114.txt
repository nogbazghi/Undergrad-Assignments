After global warming the disaster film ( " The Day After Tomorrow" ) and
global warming the comedy special ( "Earth to America " ) , the next
step was probably inevitable : global warming the coffee mug.
The mug is decorated with , naturally , a heat-sensitive world map .
When
it 's filled with a steaming beverage , the shorelines retreat , reflecting
an extreme version of what scientists say will happen as
melting ice and warming water raise sea levels .
Groups with different views on warming have come up with similarly
quirky tools to spread their views .
In December , the National
Center for Public Policy Research distributed rolls of toilet paper
at climate-treaty talks in Montreal printed with the phrase "emissions
credit " in five languages -- reflecting what it claimed is
the value of such credits , which are earned by cutting
greenhouse gases linked to warming .
The online pitch by the mug 's purveyor , a Brooklyn-based novelty company
called the Unemployed Philosophers Guild , is a bit bleak : " Have
you wondered what the world would look like after the
polar ice caps melt ?
Now see it over a cup
of coffee . "
Nonetheless , it 's been selling briskly , with about 25,000 bought last year ,
said David Shaw , who designed the mug and runs the
company with his brother , Stephan , the unemployed philosopher who started
the business in the early 1990s .
They 've received a few requests for corrections , like an e-mail that
came in last Thursday noting that the Aral Sea would
never fill up because its elevation is far too high .
" We said we 'll try to adjust it in a few places , "
Shaw said .
