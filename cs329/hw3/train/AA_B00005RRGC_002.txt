I purchased mine at Wal-mart on clearance for 50.00 and let me say it worked great , except the digital reader that shows the humidity percentage of the room did not work .
I called the company and they were incredible with no automation or holding on the phone !
I was very impressed and will buy from this company again .
As for the running of the machine , it kicks out a lot of humidity and air , doing a very good job , but there is a bit of noise from it ( depending on the level it is set on ) .
There are three levels (1-3 ) , with the 3rd being the loudest .
I do n't mind the noise on 1 or 2 because it is n't noticeable .
A nice feature is the three accuset modes where you can set three different desired humidity percentages and keep them locked in , and change them with the season ( or whenever you wish ) without needing to manually reset everything again .
It is really convenient .
The filters are hard to find since this model is out of production but it is a very effective humidifier .
