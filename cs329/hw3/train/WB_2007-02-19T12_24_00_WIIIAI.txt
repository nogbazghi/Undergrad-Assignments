Congress is considering a resolution asking Japan to apologize for forcing women into sexual slavery during World War II .
Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso says the resolution is ânot based on objective facts .
It does nât take into account Japanâs response to the issue , and is extremely regrettable .â 
It would be interesting to hear what Aso considers the objective facts to be .
And that on the official birthday of George Washington , who once said that reports of his chopping down a cherry tree were not based on objective facts .
To celebrate , Bush went to Mount Vernon and hung out with someone he may or may not have realized was only an actor pretending to be George Washington .
Bush also pretended to be George Washington : âToday , weâre fighting a new war to defend our liberty and our people and our way of life .
And as we work to advance the cause of freedom around the world , we remember that the father of our country believed that the freedoms we secured in our revolution were not meant for Americans alone .â 
Of course , that was just what Washington said only after he falsely accused Canada of having blunderbusses of mass destruction and being part of an axis of evil with England and Hesse ( although cynics said he wanted to start a war to get hold of Canadaâs whale oil ) .
Well , if you think you can do better than that ( and how could you not ? ) , have a go at captioning these pictures :
