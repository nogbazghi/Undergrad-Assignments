I purchased the "replacement " filter with no blue covering from Filters Now .
First , and it is unsubstantiated I admit , it does not appear to be made by Honeywell as it is shipped with no label in a plain box .
I could be wrong though .
Regardless , even if it were made by NASA for the space shuttle , the fact remains that it is lousy !
I live in Arizona and use the humidifier for a small apartment .
Within two hours of use ( on high or medium setting ) the top half of the filter that is not immersed in water is totally dry .
Apparently the "wicking " action of the filter is so poor that the very act of using it ( by passing air through it to humidify air ) drys the filter out such that it becomes nearly useless .
The OEM filter with the blue wrapping worked HUGELY better .
Same apartment , same machine , same season , same outside relative humidity .
With the "blue " filter , humidity averaged 40 % .
With this one , we can barely keep it at 25 % and this is flipping it and rinsing it every two or three hours .
The other way to compare is the tank used to empty in less than 12 hours and now is half full after 12 hours of use .
I understand some people claim the blue gets mildew , but at least that is a sign that it actually stays wet !
I never had mildew , but I had humidity .
I would never buy this one again .
Total waste of money .
Should have built my own from an old sweat sock for all the good it does .
