Today Bush was visited at Camp David by Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva .
Said Bush , âYou come as a friend , we welcome you as a friend , and our discussions were very friendly .â 
You know , according to the WaPo , Dr. Seuss wrote The Cat in the Hat using a vocabulary of only 236 words .
Just saying .
You know whatâs not so friendly ?
Malaria .
âThere is no excuse for malaria to continuing to kill as many people as it does .â 
That malaria sure does need a good talking to .
As does Iran : âthe British hostages issue is a serious issue because the Iranians took these people out of Iraqi water .
...Theyâre innocent , they were doing nothing , and they were summarily plucked out of water .â 
Summary plucking , a fate worse than death .
And out of water , to boot .
Then he went on about Iran and nukes for a bit , concluding , âAnd Iâm hopeful that the people of Iran will be tired of the isolation .
I would hope that there would be some rationality amongst their leaders in choosing a better way forward for the people .â 
Funny , because that â  and you âre all way ahead of me on this one , arenât you ? â  is what Iâve been saying about the United States for years .
However , he went on , âthe United States does believe that itâs in our interest that we have people-to-people exchanges .â 
Heâs not referring to exchanging the British sailors for the Iranian diplomats or whatever they were who were seized in Iraq in January and still held by the US.
No, he means wrestlers : âAs I say , we have no problem with the Iranian people .
As a matter of fact , we just sent a wrestling team to Iran , all attempting to make it clear to the Iranian people that weâre interested in having a constructive relationship , and it is the decisions of their government that are preventing that from happening .â 
Because nothing says constructive relationship like homoerotic grappling wrestling .
Speaking of constructive relationships , he reiterated his eternal support for the Gonzolator : âAttorney General Gonzales is an honorable and honest man , and he has my full confidence .
He is providing documents for Congress to find the truth .
He will testify in front of Congress , and he will tell the truth .
... But I will remind you , there is no credible evidence that there has been any wrongdoing .â 
So that settles that .
Asked if he had a Plan B if the Doha trade talks fail , he said , âIâve been asked about Plan Bâs before , on different subjects .
And that kind of means you âre willing to retreat .
Iâm a Plan A manâ .
236 words .
Just saying .
