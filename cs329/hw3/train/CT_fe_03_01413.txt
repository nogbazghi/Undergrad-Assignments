-- idea .
I went , um , to --
-- before the war was in Yugoslavia I went over there and that 's where one of my grandmothers was from and I encountered when we went -- we were with a group and we went to a restaurant and I know there were different pictures on the wall and they 're like , " Are you Americans " .
We 're like , " Yes " you know , and they 're like , " Oh , we wo n't serve you " and , you know --
Oh .
-- that was first time I had encountered that kind of anti Americanism .
Wow .
And so now I see it on TV and I think I really can understand , you know , what happening on the news and stuff , that they -- that they 'll just top that and , you know , they did n't know us and --
