Yesterday I heard what sounded like fireworks around here .
Is this some sort of Easter thing I donât know about ?
Are people booby-trapping Easter eggs ?
Because that would be awesome , I mean terrible .
Anyway , happy Sopranos Easter !
Woke up from the dead this morning , got yourself a gun .
Mama always said you âd be the Chosen One ...
Bush and family went to church for Easter services at Fort Hood , where â I had a chance to reflect on the great sacrifice that our military and their families are making .â 
Yes , the soldiers died for your sins , George .
The father , son and holy spirit
The NYT reports â Hunger Strike Breaks Out at GuantÃÂ¡namo. â 
What they actually mean is that 1 ) a new outbreak of hunger striking began in December that theyâre just finding out about now , 2 ) hunger striking has been continuous for several years now , but they have nât reported on it in a while .
Since prisoners now cannot communicate with each other , hunger striking seems ( from the glimpses that make it past military censorship ) to be less an organized resistance tactic than the product of despair and isolation-produced insanity .
Said one hunger striker to his lawyer , âMy wish is to die ...
We are living in a dying situation .â 
Non-follow-up : there is still no news out of Iraq about those policemen arrested , released and possibly re-arrested for participating in massacres in Tal Afar .
Or about the policemen who allegedly gang-raped that woman back in February .
