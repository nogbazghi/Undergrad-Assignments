Here 's a case of a government agency that is n't exactly leading
by example .
Los Angeles ' water department has spent a million
bucks in the last two years trying to convince southlanders
that the tap water truly is safe and tasty .
Meanwhile ,
back at headquarters , the staff is drinking bottled water --
and sticking ratepayers with the tab .
This is the infamous Los Angeles Department of Water and Power ,
which truly does have a tasty Sierra water supply .
This
is the department that long ago quietly bought up the
eastern slope 's Owens Valley to control the water supply and
pipe it southward .
Delicious stuff .
But apparently not up to
the department 's own tastes .
The Los Angeles Times has reported
that the city spent $ 88,900 of public money in the
last two years on bottled water .
Of all the city
departments , the water department bought the most bottled water --
$ 31,160 worth from Sparkletts .
Nothing against Sparkletts , but if there was any value in Los
Angeles ' million-dollar tap-is-tasty campaign , it just went down the drain .
This department needs a strong dose of common sense .
