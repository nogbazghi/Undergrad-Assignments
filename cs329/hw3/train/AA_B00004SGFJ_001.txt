If you 're only making applesauce , this is a 5-star product .
If you had other uses in mind , keep reading :
I thought this would replace the need for a food mill .
Not quite .
This would be better if you could vary the size of the holes in the screen .
I do n't like it for tomato sauce ; the juice was too thin .
I do use it when making spinach lasagna to get all of the water out of the spinach ( the spinach is really bone dry when I 'm done , which was what I wanted . )
