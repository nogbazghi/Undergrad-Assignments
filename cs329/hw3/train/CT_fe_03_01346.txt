Yeah .
-- and then -- and Dallas in [inaudible ] like if you get into some of the smaller towns out here in the country where people just do n't want to think for themselves and --
Mhm .
-- and they think everything needs to be regulated by the Church .
It gets a little bit past --
Yeah .
What do you think about censorship of , like , school newspapers and stuff if the -- if the students write articles that the administration decides they do n't want in the paper ?
I do n't think there should be any censorship at all .
Um , even in my high school we had prior review --
Uh-huh .
-- I was the editor of the newspaper and we pretty much could write anything we wanted --
Mhm .
-- I mean , I wrote a story about -- about the star football players stealing a bunch of stuff the school that they did n't really want in there --
Mhm .
-- kind of negative publicity for the school --
Right .
-- but it still went in .
Uh-huh .
And that was with prior review , um --
Uh-huh .
-- so , I do n't know , it 's -- in theory or in practice , I mean , in theory it 's not so bad , but if they actually do censor it , that really irritates me .
Mhm .
What do you think ?
Yeah .
I -- I agree with you .
I mean , just to play Devil 's Advocate --
Mhm .
-- for a moment , um , do n't you think the school has a right to , you know , if the -- if the school paper 's going out with the school name on it --
Yeah .
-- do n't you think they have a right to determine what goes in it ?
I do n't know .
To a -- to an extent , um , sure the reporters are representatives of the -- of the school , but if -- I mean , so is the drill team and they do n't tell the drill team what to wear and what to -- what they can or cannot do , we had a bunch of drill team , you know , members get in trouble --
-- well , I guess they probably have a code , too , but I just do n't even know that .
Mhm .
You know .
I think everybody 's in a representative , but you can only extend so much control of what limits your free speech and --
Mhm .
It als - --
-- I think if you have a responsible advisor , that 's the main thing --
Yeah .
Yeah .
I- -- I -- I do agree with you , I mean , also --
Yeah .
-- since it seems like so many of the kids who work on school papers are doing it because they 're interested in it and they 're likely to go onto journalism --
Mhm .
-- where , you know , at least ideally the purpose is to , you know , go out and seek the truth and report it to --
