the tongs where hard to grip. .so what I did to avoid sending them back . I took a pair of very small plyers and bent just the pointed ends inward ..like a claw .
Now they are excellent.grip
great .
love the long handle ...and heavy duty soft rubber .hope
this helps those of you like me who hate sending stuff back .
