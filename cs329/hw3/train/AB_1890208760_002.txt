This time John must divine the cause of stylites suddenly bursting into flames .
Is it a godly punishment for blasphemy or the work of sinister plotters ?
John , Lord Chamberlain in sixth-century Byzantium , must solve the mystery , save his friend Anatolius from execution , keep the city from being destroyed by a panic stricken populace and keep his own head from being detached from his body .<p>Mary
Reed and Eric Mayer bring Justinian and his empress Theodora to life though John 's eyes : " Caught unawares , she was simply a short attractive woman , her complexion carefully lightened by chalk , her deep set eyes accentuated by artful application of kohl , as if she depended upon enticement to work her will , rather than command . "
Theodora sees herself as the power behind the throne and John must step carefully as he serves Justinian and protects the empire .<p>As in the previous volume , the authors take us to the shores of the Bosphoros and present life in the ancient city .
Philo , once John 's instructor at the Athens academy , incidentally introduces a board game called shatranj : " . . . something to do with trapping your opponent 's king . "
This sort of historical color , along with the mystery , make this series an entertaining read .
