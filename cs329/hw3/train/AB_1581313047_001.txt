The Vault Guide to Finance Interviews is an essential read for any college student trying to start off his or her career with a high powered job in the world of banking or investing .
This is particularly useful for those seeking a job in the investment banking field , trading , equities research , or anything closely related to Wall Street .
The guide helps by telling what sort of unpleasant surprises to expect from the interview process .
If you have n't had any interviews or had n't attended an interviewing class or workshop , you will be surprised after reading this book how intense some of these interviews can get .
The Vault Guide tries be a good coach with some good behavioral tips to navigate those stressful moments .
The bulk of this book is a review of general finance skills - everything from DCF 's , CAPM , financial statements , to derivatives , PE ratios , and bond pricing .
The material is extremely comprehensive and should only be a review of what to know .
Do n't read this expecting to learn finance because there is too much information in too little space .
The final part of the Guide has a few common brainteaser questions and suggested solutions to properly answer them .
The Vault Guide is not an answer to getting a Wall Street job , but it 's a good starting point and a necessary tool in your arsenal of interview preparation .
I suggest using this as a guide to find your weaknesses and obtain other books such as " How Would You Move Mount Fuji ? "
