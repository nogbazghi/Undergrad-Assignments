The International Court of Justice rules that while genocide did take place in Bosnia ( although only the once , in Srebrenica ) , Serbia is not guilty of genocide .
The butler did it .
Or possibly Norway .
Itâs always the quiet ones .
Dick Cheney says the bomb at Bagram Air Base sounded like a âloud boom .â 
A reporter asked him if the âludicrousâ  act was a âself-serving symbolic statementâ  ( which left several ludicrous symbolic corpses ) .
Cheney agreed : â I think they clearly try to find ways to question the authority of the central government .
Striking at Bagram with a suicide bomber , I suppose , is one way to do that .â 
So the loud boom was a question , sort of like âBOOOOOMMM?â 
They text-messaged each other to make sure they did nât all show up wearing the same outfit .
