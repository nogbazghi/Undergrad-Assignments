In Buffalo , the perception is that 87-year-old owner Ralph Wilson has
lost his mind after replacing club president Tom Donahoe with
himself and his 80-year-old confidant , ex-coach Marv Levy .
But there 's
another way to look at it if you can get
past any age bias .
What does Wilson have to lose besides football games ?
He 's already
gone the conventional route , bringing in a supposedly bright football
mind in Donahoe five years ago and turning over to
him all the power except that which comes with ownership .
He let him hire two head coaches , trade for Drew
Bledsoe , pay millions to Lawyer Milloy and a lot of
other guys who did n't pan out as well as Milloy
has , and run the draft with a free hand .
He
stayed out of the way .
The result ?
Five years without making the playoffs , a 31-49 record ,
and more question marks at quarterback and along both lines
than he had when Donahoe arrived .
So was it crazy
to fire him and bring in the winningest coach in
team history to oversee the place ?
This is not traditional thinking , and the move has been ridiculed
around the NFL .
One Buffalo columnist called it not only
" a step backward " but " an attempt to borrow from the
Bills ' glorious past and curry favor with a disgruntled fan
base . "
Maybe this is just a case of an owner turning to
someone he not only believes knows more about football than
anyone he 's ever met but is also someone he actually
knows .
That the man is 80 does n't mean he 's forgotten
how to win football games or what the difference is
between , say , Mike Williams and a real No. 1 draft
choice .
Many people were saying Wilson was crazy when he let Donahoe
use a No. 1 pick on a guy who could n't
play for at least a year and maybe never would .
That guy was Willis McGahee .
That " crazy " move worked out ,
so who 's to say this one wo n't ?
