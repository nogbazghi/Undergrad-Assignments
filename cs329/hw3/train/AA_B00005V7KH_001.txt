I 've had this attachment for over a year now and love it .
The clear plastic bowl is dishwasher safe and tough as nails .
It also snaps off the white base so you do n't have to put the whole thing into the dishwasher .
The white base is the only piece that is n't dishwasher safe since it has parts inside of it , but I do n't put the blades in the dishwasher ( treat them like knives ) .
I use the momentary ( " M" ) setting for the food processor blade since the " M" setting is at full speed (you need speed ! ) and it only takes a few seconds to mince stuff ( this is one powerful motor ! ) .
I use speed 1 for the slicing blade , and speed 2 or 3 for the grating blades since centrifugal force will cause food to stick to the inside of the white disc holder rather than dropping into the bowl if you turn it on too fast .
You 'll get that with any food processor you buy , however , so this is n't unique to this product .
The base has a special feature that only engages the drive shaft when the top lid is snapped on completely , so this is a nice feature .
Overall , I 'm very happy I went with the Bosch Concept system and with this food processor/slicer/shredder .
