I do n't know .
It -- it 's just so strange to know that this is even going on and I know life will never be the same again --
Yeah .
-- for our generation , and -- and for those , you know , li- like your kids growing up .
Mhm .
I do n't think they 'll ever have that innocence like I had when I was growing up .
Yeah .
And that 's a shame , that that --
I think o - actually , one thing , I mean just , you know , working for the -- hi- him -- my husband working for the airlines , I think we 've become way more conservative in our spending .
Mhm .
You know , be- since Sept- September eleventh because , um , his industry was affected so dramatically , um , I mean it -- you could , you know , save all the money in the world and still the world could end .
