Then I get the -- oh , I do n't mind .
I already had -- waited on hold for about twenty minutes earlier and I gave up .
And then they just called back , so ...
Have you done -- have you done this a lot ?
I have never done this before .
Have you ?
This is the first call I had .
This is my first one , too .
That 's funny .
They actually called me today to set up the account --
Oh , really ?
-- 'cause I just signed up a few days ago , so it was real --
Oh , what --
-- really weird .
Yes .
I did n't wanna give 'em my social security number online , so I did n't com- completely complete my registration .
So , they called me .
They must be desperate or something .
Yeah , that is kinda scary , give that out .
Yeah .
I do n't feel comfortable with it , so I just -- and she said , " Oh , do n't worry about it .
We do n't need it " .
" Oh ?
Okay" .
You better pay me , though .
All right .
We 'll see .
We 'll see .
If I do n't see a check , I 'll know why .
Yeah .
But I 've got their phone number , so ... anyway .
So , whereabouts in California ?
Uh , it 's a town called Bulzura[ ?] .
North , south ?
It 's , like , uh -- it 's by San Diego .
Oh , beautiful down there .
Oh , man .
Really beautiful down there .
Yeah , it 's the San Di- -- yeah , just inside of San Diego county .
Yeah .
Well , I have --
We get so spoiled with the weather down here .
Oh , my gosh .
Oh , yeah .
I have family that -- that , uh , live [inaudible ] more distant family , but I 've been there and it 's just beautiful down there .
Yeah .
Just beautiful .
Very lucky .
Yeah , I live in Portland , so ...
Well , you do n't have to .
It 's a free country .
Yeah .
Yeah .
But , uh -- and my -- my , uh -- one child 's actually in California right now doing Disneyland for the week for spring break , so ...
Oh , wow .
Yeah .
She 's having fun .
That 's quite a nice trip .
Yeah , they actually took the car , so ...
What , is it like a school thing or they just went on their own ?
Uh , no , she went with grandma and grandpa .
Oh .
Yeah .
Out there at all those restaurants , supporting the minimum wage workers .
That 's right .
You 're doing your part .
Yes , we 're doing our part to , uh , re - revitalize the economy .
Or -- or they are , at least .
I 'm not .
I 'm trying my hardest not to spend money .
Right , I know how you feel .
Personally .
I have everything going on lately .
Anyway ... la la la ...
