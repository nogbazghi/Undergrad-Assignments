Watching the expressions on the faces of these hostages , er families , at the press conference on C-Span was intense .
I am sure these people are busy trying to scrub themselves clean this morning .
It kind of reminded me of those images of Saddam Hussein patting the head of an American child held hostage just before the first Gulf War ( the one where bush the elder committed huge war crimes yet still saw the lunacy of taking over Baghdad ) .
