As you pour over all the wonderful black and white images and run you eyes over the artistry and talent it took to create most of these long gone structures you can help , but pause and take a deep breath .
This book has scholarly , exhaustively researched text that enlighens and educates the reader .
I agree with one articulate reviewer that stated that the author did not make allowances for market forces and changing times , but having said that , I do believe that most of these buildings could have been saved and used for other purposes , I mean the retrofited old buildings in NYC and Boston , why not Washington .
The destruction of so many buildings is unconscionable , and when you see the buildings that replaced them all you do is stare .
I was not around in the sixties so i didnt witness the worst of this senceless destruction , but i know that here in Houston , even today , great old buildings are never totally safe , it 's no wonder Europeans do n't get us , as an American i do n't get us either .
Highly recommended ..the book and perservation .
