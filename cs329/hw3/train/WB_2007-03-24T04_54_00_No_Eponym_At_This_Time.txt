When Bush looked in his eyes , he saw a comrade .
Joke from a movie from Spain I saw last night :
" Two old comrades get together and one says to the other 'Everything they told us about Communism was a lie ! ' and the other says ' What is worse is everything they told us about Capitalism was true . '"
It 's a tough joke in the States , since the " they " refers to the Party/Kremlin/Pravda , but it is still funny .
Have you all seen http ://songun-blog.blogspot.com
?
It is your # 1 source for information from the Glorious Democratic People 's Republic of Korea , Dear Leader , and the Banner of Songun ideology , concerning the Bush clique of imperialist fascist warmongerers .
It is written by a right winger ( Moonie ) who tries to make it a slam on the Democratic Party , but it is funny , and I rarely see pictures of North Korea , anyway .
