Even still -- even now , still , you know , especially with what went on in Iraq .
Right .
You know .
And they call us with this holy jihad against the United States --
I know , it 's terrible .
You know .
It 's so bad .
You never know what they might be planning .
No. No, I agree .
Like , I 've never been much of a flyer , but even now , just -- more than just the fear factor , like , they just showed on the news that the biggest airline 's about to go bankrupt because --
Mhm .
-- of , of what happened even back in September eleventh .
Yeah .
And it 's just weird how it just trink - trickles down to just a airline going bankrupt .
I know , exactly .
So I guess a lot of people probably feel kinda like I do .
Maybe they just do n't wanna take the chance --
Mhm .
-- of getting on a airplane --
Right .
-- right now .
Yep.
No, it is a -- it is a concern .
Mhm .
But I guess we just keep on living .
Yeah .
And my aunt , she works on a military base .
Mhm .
And um , she 's looking for a new job now , because she said after September eleventh , it 's like really hard ...
Oh , really ?
...to get on and off the base .
Um , because she does n't drive , so someone always takes her to work , and --
Mhm .
-- they could no longer drive her close to the ba - building where she works .
Oh really ?
Because -- 'cause they could not come on the base at all .
Oh , incredible .
So she has a nice little walk from where they can drop her off --
-- to where she actually works , and she 's like --
Right .
-- that 's a big inconvenience .
No kidding .
So there 's just another example of how September eleventh have just changed a lot .
Yeah , that 's true , yeah .
More than just our own willingness to change --
Yeah .
Or , or inside , it 's actually forced to .
Yeah , yeah .
Yep , that 's so true .
Mhm .
And then unfortunately there 's some Americans who would like to take September eleventh out on Arab Americans , I guess --
Yeah .
-- you could say , you know .
That 's really unfortunate 'cause it 's not really their fault .
Yeah .
I agree , completely .
Mhm .
' Cause they are pretty much running away from that --
Yeah .
-- you know , by coming here .
Uh-huh , that 's the whole reason they 're here , to --
-- create a new life .
But that is unfortunate .
Yeah .
I heard a couple of stories of the news of kids were harassed at school , and neighbors harassing neighbors because of , you know , they were Arab Americans and stuff .
