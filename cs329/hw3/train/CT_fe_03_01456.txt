-- three countries that were --
Yeah .
-- really involved .
There was n't just the American people there .
Right .
Right .
And one of the -- yeah .
One of the things I remember thinking is 'cause -- 'cause of the basis for that , it 's just the -- the strong hatred of , like , America -- Americanism and American people , and almost just wanting to , like -- they want to just , like , destroy as many as they can .
And I remember one of the things I 'm thinking is , um , like , here at college , like , uh , I 'm at -- I 'm at the University of Wisconsin , which is like --
Mhm .
-- a very big university , and --
Mhm .
-- when we go to -- um , like , I just remember right after September eleventh going to college football games , and security was way step -- way -- you know , it 's very stepped up .
Mhm .
But just thinking about if they really -- it 's -- it 's just -- it was such a scary thought , because especially really , we 're just so -- you know , hated Americans so much that they just wanted to kill as many as possible .
Mm .
Uh , there 's no -- there 's no , like , area where there 's more people in a small area than at a college football game .
Mm .
I mean , that when that stadium fills up , you 've got eighty thousand people sitting in there , so there was -- I def - I def - I remember the first -- they cancelled the -- our game right after September eleventh and then --
Oh , they did ?
-- I remem - yeah .
And then I remember the next one after that , security was very stepped up , but I know everyone was , you know , a little bit anxious going through it , but you know , you go on with your daily life and things got back to normal .
Yeah , that 's -- that 's true .
Uh , we --
Yeah .
We have a very resil- resilient culture .
Yeah .
Yeah .
Yes , however -- however I say that .
Anyway , that we can bounce back and --
Right .
-- that 's the thing and , uh --
Yeah .
But m - um , my travel plans have not changed --
Right .
-- and things like that , that people say , well it was -- affected this , this , this and this .
Right .
And , really , I 've gone on with my life and my --
Right .
-- plans and what I should , you know , do ?
Yep.
I might think about a little bit , okay , now what if I was cut off with my water and my --
Yeah .
-- food , so I kinda planned a little bit about that .
Uh-huh .
I do n't think that the terrorist is biological things .
Like , I have n't done anything --
Uh-huh .
