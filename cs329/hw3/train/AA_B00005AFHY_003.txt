I bought it to use it with a Bosch 1294VSK Corner Detail Sander ( that I already bought ) and a Bosch 6 " random orbital sander ( that I will order ) .
It works fine with the corner detail sander .
I used it for an hour and the hose did n't come loose .
But I cannot give it a high mark for the following two reasons :
1 .
It does n't work with other non-Bosch tools .
For example , it does n't work with my Dewalt 5" random orbital sander .
I ended up using my hand to hold on with the connection .
I probably can make them work together using a duct tape or something , or probably not .
2. 15-ft long sounds great .
But when it is connected to the hose end of my shop vac , the air flow seems to be quite low .
I think the combined length of the shop vac hose and this 15-ft hose may be just too long and creating too much friction for air flow .
Moreover , the diameter of this hose is very short ; this probably also reduces the air flow .
Having said this , I can use it to sand and still keep the dusts in the air to the minimum when I was using it with my Dewalt sander ( with my hand holding on with the connection ) .
May be the suction is still good even though the air flow is low .
I do n't know because I am not an expert in this area .
Still , I probably will like it better if it is only 5-ft long .
