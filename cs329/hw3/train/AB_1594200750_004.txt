I think this book offers solid discussion about girls and growing violence .
As someone who works with teens , as an author and ministry worker and speaker to teens , I 'm not worried about the statistics near as much as what I see happening in the lives of some of our girls .
There is more violence among girls .
Our younger girls are losing their innocence , many are accepting less than any other generation in terms of relationships , and many are angry .
I love working with teens .
This is an amazing generation .
They are intelligent .
They are able to do more than their mothers and grandmothers , but the reality is that a growing segment of young girls are reacting with violence , and this book offers some insight .
Does it have all the answers ?
Absolutely not , but neither do I , but it asks some great questions and offers some interesting information that should trigger conversations among those who care about our girls .
