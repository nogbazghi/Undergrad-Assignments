We bought this vacuum just 5 months ago and it 's already falling apart .
Where the motorized brush head connects to the rest of the vacuum broke .
To fix it the whole brush head needs to be replaced .
Just a couple of weeks after purchasing the vacuum , the attachment holder caught on a corner and part of it snapped off .
Aside from the vacuum breaking , the motorized brush head does n't suck all the dirt from our carpet .
I think the brush spins so quickly that it kicks the dirt/debris right out .
If I stand behind the motorized brush head , the debris hits my ankles as it flings out of the head .
Keep in mind , our carpets are not very dirty b/c we do n't wear our shoes in the house and we vacuum at least a couple of times a week .
FYI - we had our last vacuum , a Kenmore , for 8 years without many problems .
We 're going to try returning this vacuum and then heading to Sears to purchase a Kenmore .
