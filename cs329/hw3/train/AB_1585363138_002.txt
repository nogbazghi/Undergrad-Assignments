The Tsunami Quilt is the story of a boy and his family and how they were touched by a horrible tsunami that hit Hawaii in 1946 .
Like other books by Anthony D. Fredericks , there is a perfect mix of fact and fiction ( there are tsunami facts at the end of the story ) .
This allows teachers and librarians a chance to get kids hooked on non-fiction by reading an interesting tale .
However , the book is not just a good teaching tool , but a nice story to read at home .
I very much suggest reading this book !
