Let me start by saying I bought this almost a year ago and used it for the first time today .
I could kick myself for waiting so long !
I think this is a fabulous accessory .
I can now enjoy my apple-carrot mix at a fraction of the cost I usually pay for a cup of juice .
This attachment is perfect for me a a great product overall if you are an occasional to moderate juice and/or are strapped for counter space .
If you are a serious juicer , this may not have enough capacity or power for you .
( Since everything sits in the workbowl , you only have so much space before the juice touches the pulp .
I think you can get at least two , maybe three cups of liquid in before this happens . )
Also I was intrigued by a previous reviewer 's comment about using the pulp for something else .
Whenever I 've used a real juicer , the pulp is so dry that it is absolutely flavorless useless .
The pulp in this attachment is damp , so you 're not getting all of the juice out of the items .
However , with an attachment versus a juicer , you have to be willing to accept tradeoffs .
What I did enjoy was the lower amount of froth in the juice with this product versus a juicer .
I found clean up really easy .
I rinsed the pulp out , ran a bottle brush over it a few times and tossed it in the diswasher .
The only negative for me is that the appliance eventually started to walk across the counter .
Since it was my first time using the attchment , I admit it could have been something I did wrong .
