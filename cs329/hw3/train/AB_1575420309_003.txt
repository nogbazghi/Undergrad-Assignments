This is a " Hallmark meets child development " sort of book .
It 's got lots of "paradigms " and concepts drawn ( haphazardly , it would seem ) from serious knowledge about the subject , but it 's served up in a pretty simplistic way .
The world it hearkens to seems more like a gated community than any real city I know .
And the folksy , sometimes chummily evangelical , prose style is often clumsy and occasionally downright silly .
