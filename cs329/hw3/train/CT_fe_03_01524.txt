Yeah .
And there 's so many other people who would be like to play it just for the heck of it , you know .
I mean look at all the little sports leagues and , ah , tournaments and things that happen all over the -- all over the country , you know , where people actually pay money to play in them and these guys are whining because they ca n't get five million more out of their deal .
Yeah .
Look at golf , okay .
Mhm .
Any time that you have to play in any golf tournament or anything , you have to pay a lot of money , it 's expensive .
Mhm .
Um , even , like , the Open , they have to pay , like , an entry fee for this , it 's not free for them .
Mhm .
You know , and -- and there 's , like , you know , Tiger Woods , there 's some really good golf -- the golf athletes .
They do n't -- you do n't see them going on strike .
Mhm .
I mean , they -- 'cause they win cups and -- and -- and prize money and stuff like that .
That 's their job .
That -- you know , they 're having fun but they 're actually having to work for it --
Mhm .
-- and they have to pay an entry fee .
It 's like , I think if they had to -- if -- if a professional athlete , basketball , baseball , football , hockey , if they had to actually pay a fee to be eligible for the year beside their penalties and fines for , um , bad behaviour then maybe things would change a little bit .
Mhm .
You know --
Mhm .
-- or -- or the fans go on strike .
I 'm always surprised when the fans come back .
I mean , when baseball went on strike for that long time I thought , you know , people would be really upset and that -- that baseball would suffer for a lot longer than it did .
Especially since -- you -- I mean , all -- the people that go and watch the games , they are like your average working class blue collar people --
Mhm .
-- and they 're the ones that really love and support these leagues and I -- yeah , I was shocked that they would come back so soon since , you know , I -- I would feel if I were going to all these games and I was a big fan of these sports , you know , like how was that that I 'm making forty , forty five thousand dollars a year and I am spending , I do n't know how much on season tickets and these guys were making at least , you know , five million , a million , thirty million , whatever are -- are still whining about how they do n't make enough to live because they only have one house whereas the NBA have -- you know , they 're making this much and they can have three houses and --
