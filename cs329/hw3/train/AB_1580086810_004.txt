Hungry Planet is a moving look at what families of the world live on ...it combines incredible photography , well chosen statistics and outstanding commentary to clearly portray the diversity and real life economic situations of our fellows on planet earth .
I love this book for the way it influences my children to see compassionately and with greater gratitude ( and me too! )
