As a former member of the Industrial Workers of the World ( the Wobblies ) , I can tell you what the Legion 's 100 % Americanism is : it means the responsibility to kill members of the Wobblies and other dirty reds .
I 'm pretty sure that 's what "autocracy of both the masses and the classes " means as well--a vigilante freedom to kill dirty reds .
Few understand this , but the Legion represented the closest thing to homegrown American fascism in this country for many years ( nota bene-the use of the past tense in this sentence is not to suggest that the Legion has gotten any less fascist ) .
