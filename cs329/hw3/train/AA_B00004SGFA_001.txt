All I can say is that these are worth ANY price , for what they give in return .
It looks like they have an actual hole in the top , but its just a 2'' or so deep point that is recessed area to allow the kitchenaid top to be down when the cap is on the bowl .
It 's sooo nice because I can put some of my mixer attachments in the bowl and then put the lid on them , and nothing gets dirty even if I do n't use it for a week .
They wash very easily , which is ALWAYS a plus , and allow me to store things in the fridge ! ! ! ! Totally worth any cost for the convenience !
