Sunday morning Condi Rice was interviewed on ABC and Fox .
The theme of todayâs Condi-pics , by the way , is hands .
Chris Wallace asked , twice , if the US can âlive withâ  ( i .e . , refrain from overthrowing militarily ) the government of Iran if they âclean up their act .â 
She evaded the question twice , as Iran will surely have noticed .
She also would nât say if Bush would veto a bill restricting him in Iraq because she âcanât imagine a circumstanceâ  in which Congress would do so .
She said it would be âthe worst micromanagement of military affairsâ  ( has she forgotten Donald Rumsfeld already ? ) to interfere with the âclean relationshipâ  ( donât ask , donât tell ) âbetween the commander-in-chief and the commanders in the field .â 
She said such disruption of the chain of command âalways served us badly in the past .â 
She was nât asked to what she was referring .
She played up Al Qaidaâs supposed role in Iraq in a way that bolsters the theory that the Bushies are going to claim , if Congress does do the thing Condi canât imagine , that military operations in Iraq are covered not by the 2002 authorization of force in Iraq but by the 2001 one against terrorism in general .
She asked , âhow do you possibly distinguish what is going on in Baghdad , for instance , from the fight for al-Qaida -- with al-Qaida ?
We have to remember that some of these car bombs may indeed be the work of an organization like al-Qaida or al-Qaida affiliated allies .â 
Also , âhow can you separate , again , what is going on in places like Anbar from what is going on in Baghdad ?â  Also , since Al Qaida supposedly started all this with the Samara mosque bombing , âhow do you separate al-Qaidaâs having helped to spike this sectarian violence from stopping this sectarian violence ?â 
The scary thing is that she thinks this sort of thing is a logical argument in support of her position .
Hereâs another one : asked if the change in the nature of the war in Iraq since the 2002 authorization of force does nât justify rewriting it , she said : âit would be like saying that after Adolf Hitler was overthrown , we needed to change then the resolution that allowed the United States to do that so that we could deal with creating a stable environment in Europe after he was overthrown .â 
Isnât that a convincing analogy ?
She says of Maliki , âThe Prime Minister has been tireless in going out and promoting the Baghdad security plan .â 
Not going out in Baghdad of course , that would be crazy .
She also praises the âexcellent cooperationâ  of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia against Al Qaida : âMore al-Qaida have been caught in Pakistan and in Saudi Arabia than any other place in the world .
And so they are working very hard with us .â 
Of course , more Al Qaida have also not been caught in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia than any other place in the world .
( Update : and you know what no one asked her about in either interview ?
Her trip to the Middle East .
Thatâs how significant it was . )
