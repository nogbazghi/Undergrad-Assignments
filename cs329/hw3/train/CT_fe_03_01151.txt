Wow .
-- that I was dating and then , ah , she 'd moved away and I had n't seen her in fifteen years .
And then , ah , last year I got a phone call at my restaurant .
Someone wanting to know if it was me that owned it .
Oh .
And I married her .
Wow , that is --
It was the same --
-- so cute .
-- girl that I had known --
-- when we were fifteen years old .
Wow .
And she had -- she had seen Mike 's Family Restaurant , and she said , " You always said you were going to do it and the --"
-- only person who I could think of around here that would have a re - have a restaurant named -- you know , Mike 's Family Restaurant " and she said , " I knew it had to be you " .
Wow .
And so --
That 's great .
-- after fifteen years -- like I said , if I could go back in time I would 've -- I would 've changed that , you know , a long time before now but , ah , we have , ah -- looks like we have three little kids and I 've got a -- I 've got a five month old son now .
Wow .
And , ah , but like I said --
-- I would 've -- it would 've changed that a lot , you know , a lot sooner --
Yeah .
-- if I coulda went back in time and did it .
But --
Yeah .
-- ah , at the time I was n't thinking about it , you know .
I was fifteen --
Yeah .
-- that 's the way it works , but , ah --
That 's a great story , but you know what ?
You might not have had the appreciation of her --
Yeah , yeah .
-- so you were , yeah , older to have realised what you almost lost .
So , that 's good .
Yeah , that 's -- that made a big difference .
But , like I said --
Yeah .
-- it --
-- definitely , you know , it 's definitely not easy .
I mean , I can make a lot of things easy , namely if I could go back in time -- if I could go back to , like nineteen fifty --
Mhm .
-- with the things I know now --
-- and -- and -- and all the -- you know , all the new innovations of today --
Mhm .
I could be Bill Gates .
You could be anybody you wanted to be with the stuff --
-- you know today .
I mean --

Right .
If you could , you know , just -- the simple things .
I mean , like , you know , I mean , satellite TV .
Mhm .
You know , cordless phones .
Right .
Or computers .
