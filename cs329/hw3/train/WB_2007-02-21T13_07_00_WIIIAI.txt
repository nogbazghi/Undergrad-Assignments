Bush was in Chattanooga today to tour a hospital
and talk about health care .
But first , he bestowed yet another of his hilarious nicknames : âMayor Claude Ramsey of Hamilton County .
I told the Mayor , I said , in Texas , we call them county judges .
( Laughter . )
So I said , I might just call you Judge .
And he said , well , Mr. President , you can call me whatever you want to call me .
( Laughter . )â  
Right off the bat he misspoke : âNow , I believe the federal government has a solemn responsibility to take care of the sick -- I mean , the disabled , the elderly and the poor .â 
Phew , he almost said that the government had a responsibility to the sick , thank god he caught himself in time .
Most of the speech was the same old same old .
He did suggest that one problem with insurance plans is that states add mandates to cover things like âthe hair follicle benefit -- well , you donât need hair follicles , particularly if you have hair .â 
So he does nât believe in a solemn responsibility to take care of the bald .
He did nât say what states actually require coverage of baldness treatment and if that âs for regular male pattern baldness like some people I know â  hi Chris ! â  or for chemotherapy and the like .
All that health talk made him hungry , so he went to a restaurant called Porkers for some ribs .
Seems a little scared of those ribs .
By the way , he went to Porkers with Senator Corker , which sounds like a childrenâs book .
