Re : sugarcane--growing up in South Central Louisiana at around the same time ( late 70's/early 80's ) , I used to , on occasion , cut a small stalk of fresh sugarcane and chew on it ( all the neighbors were cane farmers ) .
You 'd spit the pulp out , but the juice was , of course , very sweet .
Fortunately , this was only an occasional thing ...and I did n't ruin my teeth .
