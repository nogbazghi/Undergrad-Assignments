And one of the questions that always comes up , when - when you hear about this , and see the contestants complaining about it - Look , they have to know what they`re getting themselves into .
So I feel like we really should n` t be feeling so bad for the contestants .
The producers even tell them , this is what you`re in for .
A.J. , we`ve all seen this show , we know what it` s like .
Look , if you`re going to go on TV , especially reality TV , you`ve got to expect to be ridiculed by public , by whatever .
Even when I do television , I know I` m going to go home , my mom` s going to say , Hey , you did great .
My wife is going to tell me I have a face for radio , I should n` t do it again .
I - everybody - we all have our own Simon and Paula .
Yes , 37 million people ; I`d like to believe that many people are watching us tonight .
It` s not - it` s not happening .
And the truth is , when you have numbers like this show has , Julia , maybe this dialogue is helping , maybe people are upset .
But number one , it` s a TV show , and number two , they`re not sitting in a boardroom saying , Well , we better address this problem and fix it .
Yes , exactly .
You know , I think that with 37 million , they`re obviously doing something right .
But as Simon said , it` s not like they`re drowning puppies .
You know , they`re telling bad singers that they`re bad singers .
And also , they`re ugly , too .
Ben , what about the idea that Rosie O` Donnell pointed out on " The View " last week , that you know what ?
OK , so maybe this is happening , and this is what people are - are watching .
But - but is n` t that a sad state of affairs for what - what goes over as entertainment on this - on - on - in our country ?
Or is your question that it` s ( INAUDIBLE ) for using Rosie O` Donnell as the barometer for this stuff .
I` m not sure which one to go with .
OK .
I mean - I mean , look , you know , it is what it is , like I said .
The - the show is fantastic ; it` s through the roof .
People - you know , train wreck is what you tune in to see .
You tune in to see people get ridiculed ; you tune in to see people get ripped apart by Simon ; you tune in to see what` s going - what Paula` s going to do next .
Is she going to fall asleep on camera , or start clapping like a seal ?
You do n` t know what to expect .
Not to belabor the point , but I` m having a hard time getting past the physical - the physical part .
Yes .
But , you know , you have to remember , though : this is a small percentage of the actual show .
The actual show is n` t all train wrecks .
I mean , they have real talent there .
So if - if the - the whole show were this , maybe we could criticize it .
But it` s just the auditions .
