This was a wonderful book , but I could only take it in small doses .
It took a couple of months for me to read it .
I would also read more light hearted short stories before and after chapters to keep from being too affected by it .
As a mother of young children it was especially difficult to read , but important to have an eye open to the suffering of others in our world .
The author told the story well .
