We are very happy with this mixer .
It works fast , easy to clean , powerful and attractive .
We use it every day and it takes up very little space on the counter .
My husband uses it to mix his protein shake and claims if you let it mix more than 10 seconds it becomes to foamy with too much air , so if you use it for powder shakes , unless you like it foamy do n't let it mix more than 10 seconds .
For frappes or milkshakes it takes more like 30 seconds .
<br> It works great , just fill the liquid to the fill line set it up and rest it on the stand and the cup presses against the on button( hands free ) and releases when you remove the cup by tilting back a little and removing the cup .
Then to clean , rinse the cup fill with water and rest it back on and let it mix a few seconds then remove cup ,unplug unit and wipe the blade and cup dry .
So simple .
Its great for quick shakes .
We thought it was a little costly , but we are not dissapointed with the product .
