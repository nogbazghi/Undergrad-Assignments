Yeah .
And I would like do a couple of laps three or four times a day .
That -- that 'd would be wonderful to have available .
Yeah , it was so good for me .
It was really nice .
And then I 'd go out , sometimes at night , and just float in the water .
Yeah .
You know and , um -- I do n't thin- -- I think they had some fitness equipment or something , I 'm not sure .
I do n't remember .
I know I was n't interested in that you know .
Right .
Yeah , exactly .
I just liked the pool .
Sure .
But I would n't have this if it had n't been given to me but it 's a -- a godsend in many ways just , you know , being able to stretch where I ca n't really exercise .
Sure .
And they have a public pool and the pool is , um , is called Potese Pool .
It 's a little place for -- it 's for handicapped people .
Right .
But it 's only like four feet deep and you ca n't really swim in it .
Right .
And it 's like -- takes the fun out and then everybody goes and they get hot and so they open the doors and I ca n't stand the cool .
Sure .
I have to be warm .
And since I ca n't stay under the water --
Right .
-- my shoulders and stuff and I just quit going .
Oh , that 's too bad .
It 's sort of a waste of a resource .
I 've often thought about it .
Mm ?
It 's sort of a waste of a resource .
It 's sort of a sad story .
Yeah .
It -- a lot of people --
It could be a comfort to you .
-- utilize it .
People with heart problems and stuff .
Yes .
And , um , mobility -- more mobility than I do but I just --
Sure .
-- ca n't -- I have to be warm .
But it could be a great comfort to you --
Mhm .
-- if it were just a little different .
Yeah .
As I had my brothers -- we bought a fixer upper home , or we we 're -- we have a lease option and I would put in a , um , if it was large enough -- I would knock the kitchen out and move it around a little bit and where our closet is I 'd put the bathroom and put a , uh , one of those hot tub bathrooms , a roman bath --
Yeah , like a jacuzzi .
-- with the spas and stuff in it , yeah .
Yeah .
Yeah , instead of a regular bathtub have that with a double shower in it .
Those are n't as expensive as they used to .
Yeah , they 're about two -- twenty five hundred dollars , I think .
Right , well it 's not unattainable .
