At the last press conference ( I pray to great muppety Odin ) of Condiâs triumphal trip to the Middle East , she repeatedly called Abbas and Olmert âserious people .â 
Maybe the joke was just too subtle for her .
NO USE SITTING ALONE IN YOUR ROOM : âAnd so I think the really important thing that weâve done over the last few months is that theyâre not in their corners ; theyâre in the same room and theyâre going to walk down a path together .â 
NOT , REPEAT , NOT A DOUBLE ENTENDRE : âAs you will remember , when I came here I talked a lot about doing this in parallel and doing it with each of them bilaterallyâ .
REALLY , NOT EVEN SLIGHTLY A DOUBLE ENTENDRE : â But last time I was here , I think we were able to regroup in a sense .
We were able to hold the trilateral .
But then the question became what would the Palestinians and Israelis be able to do together .â 
