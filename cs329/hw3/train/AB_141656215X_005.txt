I just do n't understand Carol Higgins Clark 's appeal .
Her characters lack any depth and you always know exactly what everyone 's thinking .
Dialog is flat and not particularly humorous .
And soon we know , in v-e-r-y s-i-m-p-l-e t-e-r-m-s , what 's going on with just about everyone .
Not recommended .
