I 've used the pyrex glass containers with plastic lids for over 10 years , and although they 've held up well , I wanted a no-plastic solution for refrigerator food storage .
I ordered this from Amazon , despite another review noting that the lids do n't fit properly .
Yup , they do n't .
I ordered 2 different sizes , and neither lid fits right , leaving my leftovers to dry out in the fridge .
I could put up with that , but the darned things are also so heavy , and I 'm not old and weak , but I 'm getting tired of the weight of these things , especially when filled with food .
The glass is so thick ...
On the positive side - they are better than plastic ( any glass or ceramic container is ) , they look retro-cool , and they stack well in the fridge .
But for me , I 'm going back to using my pyrex with the plastic lids ( I wash the lids by hand to prevent the plastic from breaking down ) .
