The CorningWare 23-Ounce French White Oval Dish is the perfect size for two people , for so many things -- marinating a small piece of meat or fish , a serving dish for vegetables , baking a small casserole , defrosting small items in the microwave .
I ca n't imagine why Corningware stopped producing them .
