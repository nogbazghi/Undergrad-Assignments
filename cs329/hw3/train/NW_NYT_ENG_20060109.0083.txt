Placing another barrier before the misguided school voucher movement , the Florida
Supreme Court last week rejected part of the nation 's only
statewide voucher program .
While state-to-state voucher rulings have been mixed ,
the handful of similar programs nationwide should take a lesson :
Precious tax resources should be focused on fixing struggling schools .
If that fails , shut them down and move students into
more successful public programs .
In a 5-2 ruling , the Florida high court said the program
is unconstitutional .
Other voucher opponents had argued that the program
violated church/state rules --a position a lower court affirmed .
But
the state court overturned vouchers based on educational , not religious ,
clauses in the constitution .
Justices said the state provides for
a "uniform ... system of free public schools , " and that
a voucher program "diverts public dollars into separate private systems
parallel to and in competition with the free public schools
that are the sole means set out in the Constitution "
for publicly funded education .
In Florida , about 700 of the state 's 2.5 million schoolchildren attend
private or parochial schools through the Opportunity Scholarship program .
The
decision does not affect another 30,000 students in similar programs
for disabled and low-income students .
This ruling underscores the bedrock American notion that universal public schooling
has an equalizing , unifying effect that is well worth preserving .
Though public systems clearly need to improve , they should not
be abandoned or diluted .
