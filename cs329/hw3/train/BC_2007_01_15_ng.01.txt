Danielle , let` s start with you : Is it a confession ?
DANIELLE CAMINTI-AIDALLA , FORMER ASST.
DISTRICT ATTORNE
Absolutely it` s not a confession .
If it was a confession , he would n` t have come so close to the line without crossing it .
He would have given every explicit detail about how he did it .
Again , it` s O.J. thumbing his nose at the legal system .
He is untouchable .
He beat the criminal charges and , again , he` s trying to avoid paying any money to the Goldman families .
VELEZ-MITCHEL
Well , Alan Ripka , are we going to have a face-off , or do you also feel this is not a confession ?
We are going to have a face-off .
I believe it is a confession .
You know , the devil` s in the details .
And he may claim he learned a lot during the course of the trial , but he did n` t hear any of the things that he said .
And those things would only be known to the killer , or a witness , and there are no witnesses alive .
So , therefore , it` s O.J. Simpson speaking and narrating what happened at that time .
VELEZ-MITCHEL
Well , Danielle , you heard it .
I`ll give you a chance to fire back .
CAMINTI-AIDALL
I do n` t buy it .
I do n` t buy it , because if it was a confession , again , he would have described exactly how he slashed his wife` s neck and he slashed Ron Goldman` s neck .
He would have not kept out those significant details .
And again it` s O.J. just being O.J. It` s him saying , " I` m invincible .
You ca n` t touch me .
I have the dream team , and now I wo n` t pay any money . "
VELEZ-MITCHEL
Everybody` s got an opinion on this one .
Let` s go to the phone lines .
Theresa in Kentucky , your question ?
If O.J.` s book is leaked , or part of it is leaked , and there` s a detail in the book that is known only to the police , can he be retried ?
VELEZ-MITCHEL
That is a very good question .
And let` s go to former King` s County assistant D.A. , Danielle Caminti-Aidalla .
Obviously , we all know about double jeopardy .
And once you`re acquitted in a criminal case , as he was , even though he was found liable in the civil case , you ca n` t be tried again for the same crime .
But if , in fact , let` s say more details came out about this , could there , hypothetically , be some other charges that he could face ?
CAMINTI-AIDALL
Hypothetically , maybe only on the federal level .
As we know , in California , the California state tried him and he was acquitted .
So , therefore , no other charges can be brought .
But if you know if the feds want to get you , they`ll get you .
And they waited 10 years , that probably means they`re not going to bring in any more charges against him .
VELEZ-MITCHEL
Now , Pat Lalama , we`ve all been talking here about details only the criminal would know .
But , of course , we all sat there and watched this trial , the entire nation , the entire world .
So how many details are still left that only the criminal would know ?
And are any of them contained in this book , according to " Newsweek " ?
