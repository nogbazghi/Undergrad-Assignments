As part of the Third Grade curriculum we study several California tribes.This is an excellent source of information about other Native Americans that I like to introduce to my students .
They enjoyed listening to the descriptions and looking at the various illustrations .
It was filled with interesting facts that made learning about various tribes and their symbolisms meaningful and part of the curriculum .
