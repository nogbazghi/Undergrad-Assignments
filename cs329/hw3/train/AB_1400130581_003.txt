I have two boys between 5 and 8 years old , and read this aloud to them at bedtime over the course of a month or so .
They stayed very engaged and eager to hear what happens next .
In fact , it was hard to stop reading sometimes and get them to calm down and go to sleep !
The language was a little "old fashioned " and needed some explaining at times , for kids their age .
The very detailed descriptions of Egyptian agriculture , hunting , and embalming , as well as other religious customs , was a bit long and tedious at times , even for me ( the reason for taking off one star . )
But that is typical of Henty .
I would recommend using this as a good history suplement , that will allow you and your kids to connect the facts of history and remember them better , because they are set in the context of an exciting story .
Moses makes a small cameo appearance , but the book is not overtly Christian .
It ties the pantheism of the many Egyptian "gods " to the individual attributes of a single monotheistic God , in a remarkable scene between the high priest of Egypt and his son , who must flee Egypt to save his life .
The connection is later made to the God of the Hebrews , when a Hebrew slave girl joins the group .
The values and morals of the lead characters are strong and timeless and great for boys particularly , which I believe was Henty 's intent in most of the stories he wrote .
We are now reading The Treasure of the Incas , which is also rich with culture and history , but the story is a little more exciting , as it involves the search for a secret treasure , something all little boys love .
