Once again in todayâs radio address , Bush attacked the Iraq bill for including funds for non-war-related things such as peanut storage .
Peanut storage is sort of a sore subject for Bush , who as a child had to be taken to the hospital 57 times after stuffing peanuts up his nose .
Speaking to the Republican Jewish Coalition Leadership , Dick Cheney demanded âthat Congress should make all the tax cuts permanent -- and that includes ending the federal death tax .â 
The death tax is sort of a sore subject for Cheney , because he is one of the undead , which is kind of a gray area , death-tax wise .
Cheney went on to accuse Congress of ânot supporting the troops , theyâre undermining them .â 
He went on , âAnd when members of Congress speak not of victory but of time limits , deadlines , or other arbitrary measures , theyâre telling the enemy simply to run out the clock and wait us out .â 
Itâs interesting that itâs deadlines he labels arbitrary , since there are hardly any objective criteria for the achievement of âvictory .â 
If Bush declared âvictory , â  it would be ( to quote the dictionary definition of arbitrary ) , âbased on random choice or personal whim ... contingent solely upon oneâs discretion .â 
The Sunday Times of London says that Russian tv stations have been given lists of politicians who may not ever be mentioned on-air .
Un-persons , if you will .
And up in Socialist Heaven , George Orwell is saying , â1984 was nât meant to be a userâs manual , you know .â 
