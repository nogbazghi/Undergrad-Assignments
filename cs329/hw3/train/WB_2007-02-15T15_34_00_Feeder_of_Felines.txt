So now it occurs to Bush that maybe Afghanistan is n't in such hot shape after all .
Things there would have been a lot better , if he had not diverted funds almost immediately to the Iraq invasion , and had instead put more into reconstruction in Afghanistan .
For a fraction of what has been spent in Iraq , one could have made enough improvements in Afghanistan to prevent the return of the Taliban and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar 's lot .
It would probably have been necessary to use US troops to put the kibosh on the `` warlords '' ( i .e . , the jihadis who are somewhat less awful than the Taliban and Hekmatyar ) , but far fewer would have been killed than have been killed in Iraq .
The LMSM has not even tried to get Bush to answer for this .
