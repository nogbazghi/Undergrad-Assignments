But I even , um , I even traveled since nine eleven and with all the security at the airports and all the -- the changes that had made -- they made in society as a result of nine eleven , it made , um -- and even when I was at the airport , I was one of the people that was pulled out of the line and searched and , um , and I could of taken the attitude of , you know , be -- it was a bother to me , but I made a joke out of it and I even had the -- the security people laughing because to me it -- it 's a part of -- it 's a part of what -- the way we have to live now as a result of --
Mhm .
-- the attack itself , and -- and I mean , I 've traveled to other countries , to the Middle East , I -- I 've been through Russia , where the other countries that live like this on a day to day basis .
I 've been to --
Right .
-- Israel , and they live with people walking down the streets with guns , and we have n't come to that , but yet , we 're getting -- we 're not -- we 're not there , but we 're close because the , um , um -- you know , because now we have the -- th - the security checks at the airport and --
Right .
-- and things like that , so --
Right .
-- we 're having to come to live differently in our society as a --
Mhm .
-- result of --
Mhm .
-- the terrorist attack , but we 're nowhere near where people are in other countries , so --
Right .
-- you know , it 's different --
Right .
-- um , for us , but it makes you start thinking about -- like you say , how are your kids going to grow up and whether they going to have to deal with --
Mhm .
-- as a result of it .
But like I said , it -- it just makes me want to get closer to my family --
Right .
-- and , um --
Right .
It does question me a lot , like , the government and , you know , what is he doing ?
You know , an- it 's really the last choices for all --
Mm .
-- us , you know ?
Mhm .
If -- if there was -- you know , if we were to vote , would we vote , you know , against all this , or would we vote , you know , pro ?
I -- I think -- I think the majority would vote against , you know ?
An- and -- and still , you know , we 're still going to war .
We 're still , like , you know , doing all this stuff and now --
Mm .
-- they 're building a memorial , it -- it -- it just , like , for me it 's just so weird , you know , it 's just kind of like last sense of what 's really important , you know ?
