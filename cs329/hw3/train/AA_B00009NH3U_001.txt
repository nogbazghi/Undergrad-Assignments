This was purchased thru Amazon .
The first arrived with the wires outside the case .
Amazon replaced it without any problem .
Now the reset light and button does not work .
I 've spoken to Electrolux and they do n't have any answers .
They referred me to a local repair site .
When I spoke with them , they said the item was probably made abroad and they will not fix it or know anything about it .
I again called Electrolux and they gave me two other repairs sites .
Both told me they do n't repair .
I 'm stuck with a $ 500+ item that no one knows how to repair or will take responsibility for it .
