OK , we love coffee . . .
this is the first maker since our old Starbucks Barista version died that surpasses what we had - Braun , Cuisinart .
Capresso makes a 500 model that does n't have the steamer - I would suggest it also to save a few bucks .
The controls are elegantly implemented , the dripless carafe is brilliant ( REALLY!FINALLY NO DRIP ! ! ! ) and the steamer which originally was an indulgence is just too much fun. When we set it up there was a fitting on the steamer that was not sealing correctly - Capresso immediately sent us another entire body - it was just a painless great service experience .
I do not work for this company - but will definitely suggest their products in the future .
