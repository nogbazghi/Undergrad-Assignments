there are so many books on ww 2 itself as well as individual battles fought in ww 2. for the novice or a person who wants a general overview of this war should start here .
the book starts off with the end of the first war and the build up of the second world war . it touches on key battles and a few lesser known ones .
the book ends with how nations are rebuilding and US and USSR start an arms race - basically starting the cold war .
overall this book is terrific !
a must !
