It comes assembled , but you need to disassemble to remove the packing .
You would have to do this anyhow to clean it before first use , so this is n't a negative .
Filled it with water and some anti-bacterial solution and turned it on .
House went from 20 % to 45 % relative humidity within a day on medimum fan speed .
The unit is upstairs in the largest part of a 3800 sq ft house .
High fan speed is noisy .
Medium is loud but bearable .
Low is nearly silent .
When you move air with a fan , you 'll get noise .
If you want a silent humidifier , you 'll need to get one that is installed inline with your furnace/AC fan ( spelled $ $ $ ) .
Construction is basic... plastic .
Some may say it 's cheap , but I say it 's easy to clean .
Remove the fan housing ( simply lift it off the base ) , remove the filter and you have a big plastic box that is easy to clean .
I like it .
Fan is also easy to access for cleaning .
I have another humidifier on it 's way because I thought I would need two for a house this large .
Probably could have gotten away with this one alone , but I 'll run both on low fan speed and reduce the time they are on , indirectly increasing the life of each ...
I hope .
