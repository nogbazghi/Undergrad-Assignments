I 'm a big fan of upright cordless vacuums for daily pickup of dog hair and dust bunnies on our tile and wood floors .
These guys ca n't replace the power of a regular corded vac on carpets but are nice to have around for easy inbetween jobs on hard surfaces .
After our old Eureka Boss died which we absolutely loved after a long life , we found they 're not made anymore so decided to try this one .
It 's more powerful than the usual cordless uprights but is a pain to use .
It shuts off if stood upright ( it 's supposed to ) and is very heavy to manouver around or get up and down a stair or two .
The cannister fills up quickly .
On the plus side , it 's better on rugs and carpets than the usual uprights .
Not great , but good enough .
For us , it 's not practical as one of the beauties of having a cordless is that the kids can help out with some easy vacuuming or I just whizz around for a quick pick-up .
This model is too heavy for my children ( 8 & 11 ) to move from room to room where there are 2 stairs and they bang it on my hardwood floor accidentally as they try to lift it .
It 's also too heavy for me as I have to be careful of my back .
This model will be relegated to our basement which is just one big open area as I search for another lighter weight model .
If my back was stronger , we had less furniture to manouver around , no steps , and more storage space for housing the big charger and big vacuum , I might like this model .
But as such , it 's just not a very convenient tool to use in our house for a quick clean except in our open floored basement .
I 've given it 3 stars as the suction is better than the usual cordless uprights .
We have another new one at the office ( different brand to this ) and that one is pretty useless .
The wand is a nice touch too for when you need it .
But otherwise , too heavy and cumbersome for our type of house .
And the automatic switch offs are a pain when you just want to whizz through the house quickly .
