Yeah .
Are those your kids ?
No. Um , I work in a school but it 's a proprietary school .
Oh , okay .
Okay .
But , um , that -- they smoke outside .
You know , they have to smoke outside .
It 's a non smok - -- the building is non smoking .
Yeah .
Ah , is n't that interesting .
Mhm .
So , you 're at work right now ?
No, I 'm at home .
Okay .
Yeah .
' Cause I hear lots of noise in the background .
That 's because we have the , um -- we rented a -- this DVD , um --
-- or bought it , rather .
It was , uh -- what is it ?
After -- Friday [inaudible] , yeah , that 's it .
Oh , okay .
Never heard of it .
And my husband happen to have the TV always has it so loud .
Oh , is he -- has he -- does smoking affect his hearing ?
No, he just -- for some reason it 's because he got that , um , that bowls entertainment center , you know --
Oh , yeah .
-- in the -- in the house and so he likes to be in -- like he 's in a theater or something .
Surround sound .
Surround sound .
Right , that 's it , surround sound .
That 's it .
I 'm going like --
Well , do you go -- I used to bowl and I would come home and wash everything .
I mean , I would n't even wear a coat in because I knew I was gonna come home smelling like cigarette smoke .
Oh , really ?
And , um , and I 'm not so sure that 's where I did n't really get asthma --
Oh , okay .
-- or that it was n't complicated by that --
Mhm .
-- then , um -- but it 's , uh , anybody that knows me knows that , uh , they cannot smoke in my house or my car .
Right .
But if they wanna go someplace with me and they smoke --
Mhm .
-- I 'm happy to stop as many times as I need to .
Okay , yeah .
But that means -- that means we need to leave an hour earlier .
Right .
So , if we need to be there by eight in the morning , we have to leave at seven .
Oh , okay .
I see .
I see .
So ... and -- and I think that 's fair for me .
It is .
It is , and I would rather drive because if we go in their car then --
Car then you ca n't -- you do n't have a choice if --
I do n't have a choice .
Right .
Yeah .
Now , some people , like my girlfriend , um , my husband smokes and she does n't and she -- and she does n't allow it in her house , so he smokes out on the patio when we go visit her .
Mhm .
But if she 's in our car , he 's gonna smoke and she 's gonna fuss and that 's gonna be a back and forth thing .
