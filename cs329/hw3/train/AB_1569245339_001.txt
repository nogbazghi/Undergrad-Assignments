As a medical student who has scoured all of my pathology and microbiology texts for useful information regarding HBV , I was pleasantly suprised to find a book that was so informative .
Mr. Green refers to himself as a patient-expert , and he does not disappoint .
The information that he provides in this book is very helpful for the newly diagnosed .
He explains every detail in an understandable way and provides you with tools that will help patients combat this disease .
I was suprised by what little information I could find regarding the treatment of this disease .
I explored the HBV websites , pathology textbooks , and other HBV related books and was amazed by what little help they provided regarding treatment as well as self-treatment of HBV.
Mr. Green provides tips on exercise , diet , and supplementation which for me was key .
He also provides keys to reading your blood work , biopsies , and other labwork that you are destined to go through again and again as an HBV patient .
It is a little dated in some of the drug now used in the treatment of HBV , which is expected because of the constantly changing and advancing pharm .
industry .
As a future healthcare provider I will suggest this book to any HBV patient that I encounter in practice .
As an HBV suffer it is a must if you plan to help your doctor by self-management of this disease .
As a patient you have to do your part in the management of your disease .
