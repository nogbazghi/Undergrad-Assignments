Mhm .
-- stay out of the way to let them do what they 've been trained to do , what the research tells them is the best way to go about things .
Yeah , I totally agree .
Also -- yeah [inaudible ] --
And it comes back to a respect issue .
Yeah .
Yeah .
What do you think about the degree of training , ah , that -- that , ah , secondary and -- both primary and secondary level teachers get in the United States ?
I think , um , I do n't -- I --
I wonder if they need more in specialized education .
I do n't know .
In a lot of countries , you know , they have these normal -- you call it normal colleges --
Yeah .
-- that everybody -- everybody who wants to go and teach , um -- teach any kind of say , ah , primary or secondary school has to get a degree there or -- I mean , under normal --
Well , I think --
-- under normal circumstances that 's the path .
-- if you 've look at the edu- -- the education programmes and -- you know , for under graduates --
Mhm .
-- um , I think they 're really pretty good .
I think --
Mhm .
-- um , that every -- I -- I -- I 'm working on a PHD at --
Oh , uh-huh .
-- University of Washington and I have --
Mhm .
-- several friends who are working on either Masters or Doctorates in education --
Mhm .
-- and -- or in an education related field and the -- the things that they study , I think , are -- are -- are -- I think they 're very well prepared by the time they get --
Mhm .
-- to the classroom .
Um they , um -- they -- they 've got the broad background that , you know , everybody is required to have --
Mhm .
-- the sort of basics in -- in , um -- in education and child psychology or you know , whatever is --
Mhm .
-- appropriate for that level .
And then --
Mhm .
-- they do specialize enough that they are very well qualified to teach in whatever area .
Mhm .
Of course the secondary -- if -- if they 're allowed to do it that way .
So many times again , because of teacher shortages and pay and all that , they do n't --
Yeah , that 's a big thing .
-- they do n't get -- they 're required to teach things that they have not been specifically trained for --
Right .
Yeah .
-- and that 's a disadvantage to everybody .
Mhm .
Yeah .
Yeah .
But no , I think , um , it -- well , both of my kids went through public schools and --
Mhm .
Excuse me .
Um , they both are gifted , very , very intellectual , they went through special programmes and , um , they had tremendous teachers .
Now --
