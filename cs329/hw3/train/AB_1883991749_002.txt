A lot of stepfamily books give you one-size-fits-all advice .
This book does a wonderful job of showing that stepfamilies are very complex , and there is no cookie-cutter approach to forming them .
Authors Cohn and Merkel demonstrate the importance of taking into account each family member 's personality .
The authors really connect with you emotionally .
They show you that stepfamily issues are very emotionally charged , and that you ca n't discount all the feelings that arise in stepfamilies .
They describe all the hard work and emotion that goes into making decisions in a stepfamily .
It was very moving for me to read this book .
I learned that if you really love someone , and you want to make a stepfamily work , you have to throw out some of the conventional wisdom about families .
You ca n't try a cookie cutter approach ; you have to be creative .
After reading this book , I went out and bought a present for my husband 's ex-wife !
