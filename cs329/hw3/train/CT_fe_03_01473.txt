Oh yeah , you 're right .
-- w- well , we we , uh , always , uh , uh , feel secure when you see the military .
Uh-huh .
And , I mean , we 're surrounded by , uh , at least eight or ten military installations , so , uh , w- w- -- relatively we 're safe in -- in -- in this area .
But the only thing , at -- at -- at -- that has bothered me was those , uh , +nuclear power plants that we have close by .
Right .
And we have , uh , we live in a radius of , uh , five miles of one and , uh , twenty miles of the other one , so , uh uh , I -- we just do n't know , I do n't wanna think of that .
That concerns me .
It 's like I said , it was , uh , the planes flying over .
We 're supposed to be a no p - fly zone .
Oh , really ?
Hm .
Around -- round +nuclear plants .
But --
Mhm .
-- and you is forever see 'em come over .
Uh-huh .
And , you just wonder if it 's -- is that one of 'em ?
Yeah !
Get the grandkids in --
-- uh , here comes another plane !
Are they commercial airlines or military ?
Uh , private .
Mm , oh yeah -- yeah --
-- that would be scary .
Well , see , i- it 's , uh , uh , we 're -- we 're close to Charlotte motor speedway .
Uh-huh .
And all these hotshot , uh , car drivers , e- every one of 'em has a private plane .
A Lear jet --
-- or something , you know .
Uh-huh .
And there 's so many in the air , uh --
-- of course , u- uh , I do n't think it 's too much t- sort of be concerned about , but --
Mhm .
-- it makes you wonder .
Mhm .
Mhm .
And we onl- -- every so often they change the flight p - path --
Uh-huh .
And it comes right over our un- our -- our townhouse , you know --
Uh-huh .
-- I c - I can s - be sitting in the b - on the patio and here comes -- you can -- well , at night , because they stack 'em up , you know .
Uh-huh .
Uh , about every three minutes .
And you can see lights forever .
Yeah .
And they 're slowly coming down , you know , and --
Mhm .
Wow .
-- and you just think , " Well , if I was a terrorist , I could be in one of those things and write Charlotte off the map" .
Yeah .
Yeah .
But --
Well , yeah , well , now that -- now you -- that you 're saying that , we get helicopters , in fact there was one flying around us last night --
Oh .
-- that , um , I mean , just those that you -- you see military , you hear 'em .
And it 's funny because you just kinda stop and you look , I mean , I never used to notice things like that before , you know , planes flying in odd places or military helicopters or -- I never paid attention to that , and now I do .
