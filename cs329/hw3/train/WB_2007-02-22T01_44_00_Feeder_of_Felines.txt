Re Blair :
They never learn do they ?
Or perhaps his lying is really a matter of long practiced self-deception .
One value the mofo seems to have forgotten about is that of keeping obligations undertaken , among which are the British acceptance of the UN charter , and with it , the obligation to refrain from waging aggressive war .
Both he and the Bushies owe Bill Clinton big time as far as I can see , since CLinton 's negotiators at the meetings that worked out the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court were , as far as I know , among those responsible for seeing to it that the Statute does not contain a working definition of `` War of Aggression '' : with the crime undefined , Blair cannot be indicted at the Hague for his conspiring with Bush & Co to launch an unprovoked attack on , and invasion of , another country .
If someone can say more about who was responsible for obstructing the work of the parties to the drafting of the Rome statute of the ICC in regards to the definition of war of aggression , please direct us to a web site or sites with more info .
