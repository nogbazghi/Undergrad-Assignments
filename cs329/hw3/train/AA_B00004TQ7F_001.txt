ON the plus side the unit is capable of putting a lot of moisture into the air .
In the first 24 hours of running it put almost 15 gallons out .
The negatives stack up fast mostly due to poor finish quality .
1 ) The stain on the top cover has drip marks on it and portions of it look like a chemical was spilled on it removing its luster .
2 ) The back of the unit is not stained but is white and in the directions its says to leave the unit 4" from any wall which means you do see the back of the unit .
The hinges on the back which hold the cover in place and stick up were not painted and they are clearly visible .
3 ) The unit is made of plastic which is to be expected .
However the panels of the unit are so thin that they were all warped .
The top is ill fitting at best and the front panel has a clear bow to it .
4 ) Its loud on anything more then the lowest settings you cannot carry on a conversation on the telephone in the same room with it .
To sum up : It looks like junk but humidifies well .
I 'm off to go find a place to hide this from sight .
Wish it was as pretty as the picture .
