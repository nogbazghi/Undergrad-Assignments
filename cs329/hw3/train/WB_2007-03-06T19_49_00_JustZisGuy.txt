Look at that backdrop - let 's all glorify war , shall we ?
We must increase Legion membership ...
The " Seal of the President of the United States " on the podium is also inane .
What , is this like a product endorsement ?
Do they carry that Officially Endorsed podium with them everywhere they go or just slap a stupid emblem on the front of whatever podium Bush is to speak at ?
Lastly , has anyone looked at the Preamble to the American Legion 's Constitution ?
" We associate ourselves together for the following purposes :
To uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States of America ; to maintain law and order ; to foster and perpetuate a one hundred percent Americanism ; to preserve the memories and incidents of our associations in the Great Wars ; to inculcate a sense of individual obligation to the community , state and nation ; to combat the autocracy of both the classes and the masses ; to make right the master of might ; to promote peace and goodwill on earth ; to safeguard and transmit to posterity the principles of justice , freedom and democracy ; to consecrate and sanctify our comradeship by our devotion to mutual helpfulness . "
Excuse my backwardness as a non-USian , but just what the hell is 100 % Americanism ?
Is n't autocracy of the masses oxymoronic ?
I applaud promoting "peace and goodwill on earth " but how does that jive with 100 % Americanism and defending the U.S. constitution ?
I 'm not suggesting the U.S. should have no military ( though it would be nice to live in a world in which that were possible ) but it seems to me the level of militarism in the United States has gotten out of hand .
Or , perhaps , even more out of hand .
