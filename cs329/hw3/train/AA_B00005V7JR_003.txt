Well , I first ordered a cheap ... 250Watt meat grinder from Harbor Freight .
It had a plastic worm gear , did n't work well at all , so it sits on my shelf .
Then I got a hand operated meat grinder , and that turned out to be quite a lot of work .
I like to grind my own burger and was still looking for a good meat grinder .
I did own the Bosch mixer and noticed they made a meat grinder attachment ( I bought the mixer after I bought my first two grinders ) .
I have the 450 watt mixer .
I figured I would try the meat grinder .
I got the grinder and it was all metal , except for the tray on top and the push tube .
Well , I diced my meat and got ready to grind some burger ( I just do n't trust supermarket stuff - too many recalls ! ) .
WOW ! was I impressed -- this thing grinds like a demon !
perfect hamburger .
And , it ground up the meat as quickly as I could get it down the tube too ...this is the one that I will keep and use for my burger grinding .
The other two grinders that I own are going to go to Goodwill as a donation .
Money well spent ...
