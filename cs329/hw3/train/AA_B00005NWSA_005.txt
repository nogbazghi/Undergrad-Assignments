Earth to Waring , Earth to Waring : Standard American kitchens are designed with 18 " of clearance from the counter top to the bottom of the cabinets .
Your 18 3/8 " tall mixer DOES NOT FIT on most kitchen counters .
Hello , Waring , do you copy ?<p>The unit looks well made , but the ridiculously tall design makes it impossible to store .
It 's also overpriced .
It 's going back ...
