This filter did not come with the advertised prefilter .
The filter is too small for the application which is a poorly designed Euro Pro Shark Pursuit upright vacuum cleaner that is designed to shut down on overheat when the small filter clogs , and that happens in less than 5 minutes of vacuuming .
It takes 45 minutes for the vacuum to cool down enough to restart .
