If you are a man and are experiencing difficulty while trying to empty your bladder , getting up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom , or who has the urgent and sometimes painful need to urinate , your prostate may be trying to send you a message .
If you have pain in your private parts , especially after having sex or urination , be sure to consider the possible source of the referred pain as the prostate .
Prostatitis ( inflammation and or infection in the prostate ) can make a man miserable .
Benign Prostate Hyperplasia ( BPH) , better known as enlarged prostate , affects most men eventually and accounts for one of the most frequent reasons of surgery on men each year .
Finally , prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of death in men .
All of these subjects and more are handled deftly by Dr. Morganstern and Dr. Abrahams , who have written a book that is easy to understand and emminently useful .
If you are looking for answers and resources this is the book to get .
Even if you are already seeing a urologist , you need this book !
If you are having problems with your prostate , or want to learn what to do to prevent them , or are a concerned partner wanting to help and support the man in your life , I highly recommend this book .
As a man who once suffered from untreated prostatitis and middle lobe hypertrophy , I wholeheartedly endorse this book .
It may save your sanity and could certainly save your life .
