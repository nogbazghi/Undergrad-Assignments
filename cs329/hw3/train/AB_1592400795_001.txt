This book was called " Little Things Matter " when it was in hardcover .
At any rate , I think many people overlook the fact that Brillstein was one of the most successful managers and producers in that snake pit called Hollywood , with a career spanning 50+ years .
And he did n't have to be a prick to do it .
He learned a lot along the way , and this book ( and his other - Where Did I Go Right ? : You 're No One In Hollywood Unless Someone Wants You Dead ! . ) are a concise sharing of the experiences .
( He passed away not long ago on August 7 , 2008 ) .
Much of what he relates are useful in any business - I 'm a consultant , and saw many personal business experiences in his anecdotes - in fact , a few gave me some new insights on what I thought at the time were just rather odd situations .
Like any memoir , it 's unique to the person and their times .
But one has to wonder - was Brillstein the last of a generation ( mature , professional , not totally self-absorbed and with some principles ) - or did he set the example for another generation to follow ?
He certainly put his signature on a lot of people .
Food for thought .
