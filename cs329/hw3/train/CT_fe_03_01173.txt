Everybody 's waiting to see what 's going to go on in the world .
Yeah , I know , I know .
Well , I heard somewhere that if Saddam Hussein says he 's not leaving they might even go in before the forty eight hours .
Yeah , well --
I heard that somewhere .
-- that 's what they 're concerned with .
Um -- um --
Oh .
-- doing a preemptive strike --
Uh-huh .
-- and , um ...
Oh .
And d- United States knows he 's not going to leave .
But , I ca n't necessarily say I blame him for that either .
Yeah .
I mean , if the shoe was on the other foot would Bush leave the White House ?
So --
Well , no , I do n't think so .
-- ah , yes , ah --
-- I do n't think so .
-- I ca n't necessarily blame him for that .
Sometimes people need to be a little less political [inaudible] , a little more human --
Mhm .
-- and we can understand a lot more what 's going on ...
Right , right .
In this whole thing .
Yeah .
So , um , if I take the million dollars I 'll have to give you some of it ?
No ?
W- we can go shopping .
Yeah , right .
Well , I 'll have to come to Philadelphia and see the snow then .
Well --
-- I 'm trying to get down there to see some sandy beach .
Yeah , right --
[several inaudible words ]
-- and then they tell you that there 's life in the water and then -- then there 's , ah , bacteria in the water .
Do n't go in the water .
Mm .
The wonderful looking water that -- that you should n't go in anyway .
Yes , it 's nice .
Mm .
Yeah .
It 's nice .
I know .
Whoever thought on the planet that seventy percent at least of all fresh water is frozen in the north and south pole .
We would --
Oh , really ?
-- think that we ca n't drink water or have any water to drink .
Uh-huh .
That -- that makes no sense to me .
No, not really .
You -- you can dig -- you can dig oil from below the sand and below the ocean --
Mhm .
-- run some pipelines and put some plants up there on them polar caps and melt down on our water we got sitting .
Mhm .
Well , I do n't know --
But , we spend more --
-- maybe they should just --
-- money on death than life , you know , we --
-- man kind of has this suicidal spirit .
I believe it .
Think so ?
We spend far more on death than life .
Oh .
So --
Yeah , o - on things --
-- what do you think -- what do you think of philosophy then ?
