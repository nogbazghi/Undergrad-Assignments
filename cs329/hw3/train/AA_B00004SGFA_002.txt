These are wonderful .
I was never able to leave my bowl with my Kitchenaid pivot head mixer , which is on the counter , because of dust .
I now not only have the bowl in place , but I store the dough hook , wisk and beater blade inside .
I store my extra bowl in a cabinet with the second lid on top of that to keep the dust out .
The indentation in the center of the lid accepts the 'stem ' from the machine just perfectly .
