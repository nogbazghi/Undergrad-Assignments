My infant son has terrible eczema and we really needed a humidifier with high-performance and a filter .
This was a terrible choice !
The first night of use resulted in a leak that completely destroyed our wooden changing table and warped our hard wood floors .
Very faulty construction - has vents on the bottom of the unit that leaked NON-STOP.
On to absolutely everything .
This $ 40 purchase has turned into a $ 750 disaster with the cost of floor repair and a new dresser .
Wish I could post a review with no stars .
Shame on Vicks for continuing to sell such a defective product !
Do not purchase this unit ! ! ! !
