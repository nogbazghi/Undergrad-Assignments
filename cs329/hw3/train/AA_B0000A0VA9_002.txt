I actually own at least 5 different kinds of vacuums that I use for various jobs around the house , and have long been a fan of Eureka vacuum cleaners .
My little 3.0 HP canister is at least 20 years old and even though the bearings are shot in the motor , I refuse to give it up because there is nothing on the market that can replace it .
So , when we needed a light duty vacuum for the hardwood floors at the office , I purchased this little vac with confidence , figuring that at 11 amps , which is only 1 amp short of most uprights , I could n't go wrong .
The motor seems to be very powerful , with quite a bit of suction at the hose end -- until you put the floor attachment on it .
I do n't understand how the floor attachment can cut the suction power down to practically nothing , but this vacuum will barely suck up the dust bunnies floating on the floor .
And you can forget about carpeting .
My battery powered Dust Buster has more suction power than this vacuum .
The vacuum also does not come with tools such as an upholstery brush or crevice tool .
Sadly , this Eureka vacuum lives up to its negative consumer reviews .
A great big thumbs down for this one ! !
Do n't waste your money .
