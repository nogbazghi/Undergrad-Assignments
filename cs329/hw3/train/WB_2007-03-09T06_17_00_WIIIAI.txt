A NYT editorial Wednesday described one aspect of the neglect of Walter Reed outpatients : âThey have been swamped with confusing paperwork and forced to take responsibility for managing their own medical care .â 
If you âve been paying attention to Bushâs recent speeches on health care reform , you know that that âs exactly what he has planned for all of us : âAnd our view is , is that in order to have -- to worry about health care costs , the more a consumer is involved , the more likely weâll be able to deal with the increasing cost of health care .â 
Newt Gingrich , in an interview with Focus on the Familyâs James Dobson that I listened to so you donât have to , says that his attacks on Bill Clinton for his adultery while he was committing adultery himself with a much younger House staff member was not hypocritical at all : â I drew a line in my mind that said , âEven though I run the risk of being deeply embarrassed , and even though at a purely personal level I am not rendering judgment on another human being , as a leader of the government trying to uphold the rule of law , I have no choice except to move forward and say that you cannot accept . . .
perjury in your highest officials .ââ 
What I like about that quote is how he thinks of himself as a hero , running the risk of being deeply embarrassed , and itâs that very hypocrisy that makes him such a hero .
Not much else of interest in the interview .
He wants to abolish the 9th Circuit , fire all its judges , and appoint new ones .
âThis would be a perfectly reasonable court ... in France .â 
He says that we know American liberty is totally based in religion because it says so on all the public buildings .
Thereâs some religious inscription on the Washington Monument , the tallest building in DC , the first one hit by the dawn sun as the earth rotates .
Dobson must not have been paying much attention , because I would have expected him to deny the heresy that the earth rotates .
Speaking of religious monuments , Bush will be visiting a Mayan one in Guatemala , which will have to be cleansed of bad spirits afterwards .
Actually , after January 20 , 2009 , we should probably have the entire US boiled .
In holy water .
Just to be sure .
