Yeah .
I 'd rather see 'em use the money towards , you know .
My husband 's parents , he 's -- he 's forty and his parents quit smoking because he came home from school every day for months --
-- on end going , " Cigarettes are bad and you need to quit smoking or you 're gonna kill yourself" .
Oh , wow .
You know .
So , like , okay .
And they quit smoking --
Wow .
-- because he was just harping on 'em all the time .
Yeah .
You know .
Yeah .
Um --
And he 's never been a smoker .
Oh , okay .
Even -- not even socially .
I mean --
Mhm .
So , whatever they did at his school sunk in .
Yeah , I imagine .
Also , like , nowadays they have all those , uh , truth commercials .
I do n't know if you 've seen them ?
Yeah .
Yeah .
Just eliminate lies .
Yeah .
Yeah , yeah .
And , uh , I think those are really effective .
Like , uh , they always get me thinking about , like , what kind of , uh , tactics the big tobacco companies are using and , like , things like how -- how bad smoking is for you , how bad smoking is actually for you , you know .
Like --
Right , in what they 've covered up and --
And those are , like , mainly targeted towards teenagers 'cause teenagers are in the ads and I think those -- that 's where I think smoking actually starts , right .
Like , mostly in your teenage years .
If not , junior high , yeah .
Young teen .
I mean , I know some people that were young teenagers .
Yeah .
Yeah , yeah .
You know , like twelve , thirteen , fourteen .
Oh , okay , yeah .
So , yeah , that -- that makes sense .
Yeah , those are -- and they always come on during , like , shows which are , like , directed at teens .
Teeny bopper shows .
Or not even teeny bop - -- like , uh , I -- I remember I used to watch wrestling when I -- a few years ago when I --
Yeah , yeah .
And so , like , always I saw truth commercials during that time and , uh , I guess it just made sense because of the audience , you know .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
But I do n't know how much the government , like , itself is actually doing to , like -- or the federal government is doing to prevent more -- prevent kids from smoking , you know .
Right .
I mean , 'cause do n't -- I mean , I ca n't remember but one of my friends is Canadian , and he said in Canada cigarettes are , like , five or six dollars a pack .
So , a lot of people do n't smoke because it 's too expensive .
Yeah .
But , like --
I mean --
I 've -- I know , like , that the -- like , I 've -- I 've seen studies that , like , show that , like , the , uh , like , elasticity of demand for smoker -- smokers , like , who already , like , are smoking , they would pay , like , a premium on that , like , because of the taxes and everything with all the taxes , like , it 's hard to -- because of , like , the difficulty in quitting , they would pay that extra price , you know .
