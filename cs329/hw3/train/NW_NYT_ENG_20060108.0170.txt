Cox News Service SAN ANTONIO , Texas -- The call came not
too long after the whistle blew :
now ? "
It was late November .
Days earlier , Florida had beaten Florida State
on the field .
Months earlier , Florida State had beaten out
Florida for the services of one of the nation 's top
prospects , Myron Rolle .
Now , despite Rolle 's word and strong commitment
to the Seminoles , the Gator coaching staff was trying to
win him , too .
" That kind of stuff is kind of hard , " Rolle said .
" But
you have got to stay strong and say , ' Hey , that
is it , Coach . ' "
Again and again and again .
Because in recruiting , no never means
no .
" They still come , " Carl Johnson said .
" Even after I committed to
Florida .
The Michigans , Florida States , the Southern Cals , the Notre
Dames , they still came .
They try and sell that school . "
Not so subtly , either .
Here are a few of the lines
Johnson , one of the nation 's top offensive linemen , said he
heard :
If you are not comfortable where you are , the door is
always open at Michigan .
If you do n't feel it 's right , Southern Cal always has a
home for you .
" It 's all shady , " Johnson said .
It 's all a part of recruiting , too .
These oral commitments everybody
goes ga-ga over mean absolutely nothing .
Want proof ?
Just ask
Ryan Perrilloux .
He orally committed to Texas in 2004 .
He
signed with LSU in '05 .
Ask Demetrice Morley , a one-time
Florida commitment who had second thoughts and wound up at
Tennessee .
These players are 17 and 18 years old .
They change their
minds .
And the coaches sometimes are there to help them .
" They do n't understand the word 'no , ' " said Perrish Cox , a
cornerback from Texas who committed to LSU.
" It pulls you in so many different directions , " added Vidal Hazelton ,
a Southern Cal commit .
" They still do come after you .
They do n't hear 'no . '
I do n't tell them in a
mean way , but I just tell them thanks for the
opportunity . "
The pressure is constant , the kids say .
Cox finally stopped answering the phone .
He was tired of TCU
calling .
But coaches cannot stop dialing .
This is their lifeblood .
That 's why
Georgia recruiting coordinator Rodney Garner has refused to turn his
attention away from the 24 commitments the Bulldogs have until
all 24 sign their letters of intent on Feb. 1 .
" All a commitment does is identify who is the leader , " Garner
said .
" They are still getting the same amount of phone
calls .
Everybody in the world is still recruiting them .
" It is an open market till they sign that piece of
paper .
We ca n't afford to take for granted and think
we have a kid solid and then we lose him .
That would just kill us because we have got so
many needs . "
They all have needs .
Players build programs and stuff pocketbooks .
That 's
what creates the problems and the cutthroat competition among coaches .
That and ego , which drives much of the game .
" When you are on top , they figure everybody is going to
come there , " said Percy Harvin , a Florida commitment .
" They think
they are the best and ca n't believe somebody would go
(elsewhere ) .
" They talk about what they have to offer .
Then they bring
out the stat books and all that . "
They are all looking for the next Mitch Mustain .
The quarterback
went from a solid Arkansas commitment to an open-market recruit
who had half the Notre Dame coaching staff watching him
during Army All-American Bowl practices last week in San Antonio .
" You have to think how many kids change their minds on
signing day , " Johnson said .
" So I do n't blame a coach
for still recruiting a kid .
I know five or six
players who committed somewhere and then on signing day they
signed somewhere else .
" If I was a coach , I would still recruit a guy ,
too . "
Some do .
Any crack in the door is an entrance to
the living room .
But , then again , some do n't .
Especially when
the commitment is firm .
" Me and my family , we did n't want to be one of
those guys who committed and decommitted and kind of goes
back on his word and you ca n't trust him , " said
quarterback Tim Tebow , a Florida recruit .
" I wanted it to
mean something when I committed , so people could take it
to the bank .
And the coaches have just been class
acts . "
At Georgia , Mark Richt pushes until he is asked not to
anymore .
" If we hear through the grapevine a kid is committed or
in service , more than likely we will call him and
ask if it is true .
You want to ask them
if they are sure and whether or not they want
us to continue to speak with them , " he said .
" If
they do n't , we do n't .
If they still want to open
up conversation and continue to speak with us , we will
do that . "
Many continue to string coaches along .
Recruits have learned how to
play the coaches almost as well as they can play
the games .
" It 's a game to some , " Rolle said .
" They like the attention .
They like the official visits . "
For many , being fawned over by such big-name coaches and schools
is their moment in the spotlight .
It does n't matter how
hot it gets as long as nobody shuts it off .
And the coaches have learned how high to turn up the
heat .
