A previously unrecognized galaxy appears to be merging with
the Milky Way , bringing hundreds of thousands of stars into
our home galaxy that no one has noticed until now ,
astronomers announced Monday .
A survey of the northern sky has detected a huge , but
diffuse structure within the confines of the Milky Way that
does not seem to fit in with other parts of
the galaxy that contains our solar system .
Robert H. Lupton of Princeton University told a meeting of the
American Astronomical Society that the large but faint collection of
stars rises almost perpendicular to the flat , spiral disk of
the Milky Way .
The most likely interpretation of the structure ,
the astronomer said , is that it is a dwarf galaxy
that has been merging with our galaxy .
The dwarf galaxy lies in the direction of the constellation Virgo
at an estimated distance of 30,000 light years from Earth ,
researchers reported .
The Milky Way is a flat , pinwheel galaxy measuring more than
100,000 light years across and containing an estimated 200 billion
stars , including the sun , along its long , spiral arms and
around the bulge at its center .
A light year is
the distance light travels in a vacuum in a year 's
time , about 6 trillion miles .
Astronomers found the merging galaxy through the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ,
a project that for more than five years has been
mapping the distance and characteristics of millions of objects in
space .
The project is operated by a consortium of universities
and other institutions and uses a telescope at Apache Point
Observatory in New Mexico .
The latest study , which has been submitted to The Astrophysical Journal
for publication , shows that the Milky Way still is changing
and evolving , said Mario Juric , a Princeton graduate student who
is the principal author of the report .
" It looks as
though the Milky Way is still growing , by cannibalizing smaller
galaxies that fall into it , " Juric said in a statement .
