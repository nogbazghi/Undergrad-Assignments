Right .
Mhm .
Or well , you know , " This is how some people are but this is how we 're trying to raise you " and you know , so that you know , they 're gonna figure out that stuff 's all out there but --
Yeah .
-- I would like my influence being the first influence .
Yeah .
I have n't , uh , discussed that in t- uh , in detail with my daughter yet .
Mhm .
Uh , but my son is -- is almost nineteen , you know , and -- and I have with him when he was like , seven .
For some reason it just seems harder with my daughter !
Mhm .
Um , but , uh , my daughter , uh , her little friend , they ha - she has a boyfriend , you know , the -- not my daughter but her little friend -- and the boyfriend and the girlfriend were holding hands at school , and the principal said , you know , " What is this ?
Uh , what are you doing holding hands in school ? "
you know .
And , so , if they 're gonna be that , um , aware of what the kids are doing , I do hope that they are going to be conscious about what they 're reading , you know ?
Right .
When the time comes , you know ?
Mhm .
I never did get that book , um , uh , when she was in third grade , taken out of the school or off the library shelves .
Mhm .
Um , you know , I had a meeting with the -- the principal and -- and sent emails to the school board and whatnot , and everybody just blows it off like it 's no big deal .
I know .
And , you know , with -- with the -- the young kids that are home with a single mom , and I 'm a single mom , but -- but I work to -- where I can always be with my kids .
Mhm .
But a lot of mothers do n't .
So these kids come home from school by themselves , uh , come home and they 're exposed to that element out there and plus their reading , " Murder , bloody murder " --
Mhm .
-- regardless if it 's coming from a dog who killed a chicken , you know ?
And -- and talking about the blood everywhere .
I mean , that 's just not necessary , there 's so many other things that they can --
Right .
-- read about .
Yeah , I --
You know ?
Read about the -- there was a kid who -- who helped the -- the hungry man or something , you know ?
Mhm .
But , um , I do n't know .
I 'm -- I 'm surprised I got this call though !
Yeah !
' Cause I have n't had one in a long time and I was just , uh , reading on that , uh , on one of the -- the bulletin boards about this and -- and everybody was saying , " Oh , did you get another call yet ?
I -- I -- I did n't get one " .
