I originally bought this book as a gift for a friend .
It almost did n't make it to her .
Only a few pages into the book , I realized that I needed to have a copy of it for my very own .
My dedication to my friend won out in the end and I 'll be ordering my own copy shortly , but I 'm counting the days until it arrives .<p>This is the first D20 supplement I 've seen that is consistently useful in every area .
Spells , prestige classes , races , feats , magic items , monsters , templates , the description of Faeryland itself , it 's all good , meaty useful stuff .
If it talks about a major player in the world of the fey , that player is given a stat sheet .
If it talks about a magic item , that magic item 's described .<p>The
art is excellent , the editing is tight and the format of the book flows very well .<p>This
book misses five stars for a few nitpicky reasons .
First of all , it coul dbe a little thicker .
Do n't get me wrong , this is pretty much a must-buy book if you 're going to have the fey take any kind of active role in a campaign , but a few more monsters , and a few more magic items would 've added even more depth to this book .<p>Also ,
the book has some rather startling errors , most particularly the exlusion of the Mite Fighter feat which is a prerequisite for several feats and prestige classes .
Some of the other , more minor error were fixed with errata on the publisher 's site , but Mite Fighter exists in a different book entirely .
Spells & Magic , from Bastion Press , in case you 're interested .<p>Some of the templates do n't seem to be properly balanced as far as how they adjust character level , particularly the high fey and shadow-born templates .<p>Again ,
these are minor quibbles and easily corrected .
I highly recommend this book .
