I believe Desai once told an American interviewer , Walter Cronkite or someone like that , out of the blue , " You know that if you drink your own urine , after a while it turns clear . "
If Bush saw that , I 'll bet he remembered it , as I 'm sure everyone who saw it did .
By the way , medically speaking , that 's a really dangerous practice .
Also , when I asked if I would regret that picture , I was guessing every response would involve urine .
Although I did think someone who read the original caption and discovered that Lula had ethanol on that finger would make a joke involving ... lubrication .
