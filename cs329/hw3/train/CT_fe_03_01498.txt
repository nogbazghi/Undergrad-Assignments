Yeah .
I know some of our friends down here , uh , had started looking in -- you know , after nine eleven had started looking into the , uh , treatments for the anthrax and stuff like that .
Did they ?
But I do n't , uh , I did n't do that -- go that far .
And I knew a k - few people that , uh , you know , went as far as getting gas masks and things , but ...
Really ?
I just , uh , I live in the country , I got alligators for neighbors , you know !
Oh , do ya ?
Yeah .
A bear come and got our trash yesterday morning and carried it off --
Really ?
-- carried it off in the woods .
Uh-huh .
So I figure , you know , they 'd -- I think they 'd hit cities before they would the outskirts , you know , in the country like I am .
Right .
I -- I believe anyway .
Right .
Which -- we really thought Chicago would be a target .
Yeah .
And , uh , my husband 's a driver too but he drives local .
Mhm .
Um , and where he was working at the time was right across the street from O'Hara Airport , he was doing airfreight .
Oh goodness .
So , you know , it was -- he was pretty tense .
Yeah .
You know what I mean ?
When he walked out the door he saw the airport .
Yeah .
And then it was very strange --
-- since we 're so close to the airport , that there were no planes for a week or so .
Uh , that was another thing too , is the -- the small air- airc - airports were shut down and things of that sort , you know , it was -- it was eerie I guess .
Right .
You know , it was like everybody was just waiting for something to happen instead of , uh , you know , I guess Americans just go on as their business , you know .
Right .
And -- and do n't really dwell on , uh , I do n't -- I do n't even lock my doors half the time , I 'm ...
No, well , we do here but ...
Well , I know , but I mean , I do really , but I mean , I just , uh , I gotta stop and remind myself to , you know , lock my doors when I leave , 'cause , uh , that 's the way it 's getting nowadays , hmm .
Right .
But , uh , they had found a lotta the , uh , um , people that were involved in the airplanes , uh , crashes , uh , had gone to , you know , flight school down here --
Right , down with the flight schools in Florida , right ?
Yeah .
Yeah .
Yeah .
And , um , you know --
-- so a lotta that stuff was -- our -- our -- w- we were keeping up with down here .
Mhm .
And , um , I guess because it was , you know , pretty close where they were finding these things and then you sit there --
