Thats all it was , it was a fiction , you knew it was a fiction because nobody lived like that .
Yeah .
I mean , it was just fun to read .
But it wa - you know , it s because of the language and things like that .
And I dont believe that it should be , I think children should be taught that , uh , you know , I had a -- a -- a sister in law who said ,  Hey , you know , words are just a string a letters .
Thats right .
Thats it .
Thats exactly right .
And i- as long as that s all it is , it should not be censored .
Right .
My daughter home schools her kids , shes got six children .
Mm .
And she has got them reading just exactly what they have to read and nothing else .
Theyre not allowed to watch anything on TV by Disney because of Disneys , uh , backing the gays , and that s her +sporm of censorship there .
But she wont let 'em read Disney books either .
And I -- to me , that s depriving those children of a part of their childhood --
Yeah .
-- that is fun .
Well --
And she just will not listen to me when I tell her that , you know , Youre depriving your children of an aspect of their lives they may regret later and hate you for .
Mhm .
Well , I did do daycare before I moved over here , I lived in Kansas and I did daycare in my home .
And they did tell me what I could and could not allow the children to watch on TV , which I could appreciate .
Right , right .
Because , you know , I was a form of their -- you know , so I had kids show up and theyd say ,  Well , my folks let me watch Power Rangers  and Id say , You know , that s great , when youre at home you can watch Power Rangers .
But I said ,  Unfortunately  --
Its rather violent .
--  When you come over here , I am not allowed to let you watch that .
So , it gave me an out so that --
Right .
-- if I did nt approve of something , I did nt have to let em watch it .
Right .
So I said , Over here  I said , We get the educational channel and Disney  and I said , Thats about it .
But --
Well , so you watch Disney .
She wont even let em watch Disney .
Yeah .
You know , I mean , a - as long as it was a G. rated thing --
Yeah .
-- I would let the kids watch it because I had young children .
Right .
Very young .
And I let them watch that kind of thing .
But it was up to the parents to censor at home what they did nt want them to watch .
