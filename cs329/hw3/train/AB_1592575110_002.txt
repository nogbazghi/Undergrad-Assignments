The book is what it purports to be--a quick and dirty guide to the world 's conflicts .
Other reviewers , who labeled it slanted or say it does n't contain all the facts , miss the point .
If you want ALL the facts about one of these conflicts , you can find those in the long , dry books that we academics write ( please do ! we need SOMEONE to read what we write ) .
For each conflict the author writes about , he takes a particular angle .
This simplifies the story , allows readers to get an overall feel for the participants and chain of events , and guides what he includes .
For most readers , this makes the book useful and informative without being overwhelming .
For specialists ( or even just people who care about a particular issue ) it is obvious that he leaves stuff out .
As someone who has written on the subject of North Korea , I was pleased with his chapter on the subject .
In limited space , it tells casual readers what they need to know , without getting bogged down in complications .
A reviewer said it has an anti-US slant .
I thought that if anything , it had a pro-US slant .
I guess that 's a good sign that it is actually somewhat balanced .
