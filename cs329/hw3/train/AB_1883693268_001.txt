The pictures are gorgeous but the descriptions are not very fact-filled .
They are more "lyrical " than useful .
Example : in the description of C. argi , the Cherub angelfish , the author starts off " It is a " Cherub" , like a fat pretty child with small wings . "
The genera are not arranged alphabetically or in any other order that I can discern .
Another example for a fish species that I am particularly interested in obtaining and desirous to learn as much about as possible : C. aurantia ( Golden angelfish ) .
" The body shape is rounded , the mouth is tiny , and the face is so cute . "
None of these "facts " really help me learn how to keep this fish successfully .
