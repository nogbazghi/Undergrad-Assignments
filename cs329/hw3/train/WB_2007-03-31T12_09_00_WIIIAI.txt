Bushâs weekly radio address attacked the âemergency war spending billsâ  just passed , including their âarbitrary deadline for surrender and withdrawal in Iraqâ  and , once again , âsecure peanut storage .â 
He needed to add the word secure so he could get to this little joke : â I like peanuts as much as the next guy ...â  ( Theyâre not like those pretzels , which you think are your friends , then they try and choke you .
Stoopid pretzels . )
â...but I believe the security of our troops should come before the security of our peanut crop .â 
( What he may be admitting here is that the reason he was initially so slow to provide the troops in Iraq with the proper body armor was that he just assumed that , like peanuts , they came with their own natural protective shells . )
Also , the Democrats want to raise your taxes , we need to cut entitlements , special interest projects , reckless taxing and spending , yadda yadda yadda .
