I bought this item direct from Amazon on January 25 , 2008 .
The electric motor failed on Feb. 5 , 2009 .
The unit has a one year parts warranty .
Although I live in an implied warranty state , I did n't bother trying to get it fixed as I bought it with an AMEX card , so I am eligible for a refund .
At least one other manufacturer - Moistair - offers a two year warranty on the motor and a one year warranty on other parts .
That 's what I will get with my AMEX refund check .
