The word of the week : responsibility .
As weâve seen in previous posts , Bush used it repeatedly in Mexico Wednesday , and Gonzales claimed he was accepting responsibility , a term , as I said , stripped of any meaning by the Bushies .
And now Khalid Sheikh Mohammed has declared himself âresponsibleâ  for every terrorist action ever .
Is he a megalomaniac or a fantasist ?
Was he acting under pressure ?
Was it a cunning scheme to make a âconfessionâ  so obviously over-blown that it would be dismissed as unreliable by most Americans while at the same time convincing Muslims that it must have been the product of torture ?
Since he knows he will be getting a show trial that could never lead to his release , he knows whatever he says will not affect his fate one iota , so he can speak to serve other ends : disinformation , propaganda , self-aggrandizement , whatever .
What I like is how they asked him if he was confessing under duress .
He answered no .
The real answer is yes .
He is in a secret prison with secret courts , where he has already been tortured , anything he says can be and has been censored by his captors , and he will remain in the place where he was tortured after his âtrial .â 
So duress permeates everything that happens there .
Guantanamo is one giant machine of coercion , and anything he or any other prisoner says reflects that fact .
The one thing a âtrialâ  taking place in the heart of that machine cannot do is determine facts and evaluate evidence .
Bush met Iraqiâs Shiite Vice President Adil Abd Al-Mahdi yesterday and told him , âItâs hard work to overcome distrust that has built up over the years because your country was ruled by a tyrant that created distrust amongst people .â 
Yes , there has certainly been no reason for distrust amongst people in Iraq since Saddam fell .
