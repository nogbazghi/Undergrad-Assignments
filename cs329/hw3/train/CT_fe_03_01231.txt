Okay .
But a lot --
[several inaudible words ] .
Um , sorry I was just wondering , um , if you might have noticed any patterns , like -- is -- there are these kind of -- if like in a certain industry , like , companies tend to be more prying about personal details , or if like -- or if it 's just kind of random with different companies ?
Well , in -- in -- doing the temporary work that I did it was kind of random .
It 'd be kind of hit and miss .
Okay .

And it always -- to this day , it made me wonder .
You know , if --
That 's really interesting .
Yeah , I -- it -- it -- you know -- and we 've had , ah -- you know , just -- just different people from different areas or walks of life , that did n't get the job that were actually perfect for it .
You know ?
Wow .
And --
Can I -- can I ask just , um , where it was that you had your job ?
Like , wh - where these companies were based sort of thing ?
