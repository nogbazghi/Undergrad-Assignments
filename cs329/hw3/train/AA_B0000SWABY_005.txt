I purchased my upright about 2 years ago and while it continues to have good suction and cleans fairly well , I 'm disappointed that it has already developed a short in the switch area which has melted the handle and renders it unuseable for fear of a fire .
Online research reveals that others have also had this problem .
While it is probably fixable , I 'm not in love enough with the sweeper to keep it .
It does not lay flat enough to clean under tables , and the on board hose and tools have a habit of falling off at inconvenient times .
The other inconvenience has been finding replacement bags anywhere but online .
