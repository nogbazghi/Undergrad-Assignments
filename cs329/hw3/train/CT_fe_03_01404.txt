My mother did that once and it -- she 's still -- she 's eighty five and still has , you know , troubles .

Mm , mm , mm .
So -- and that 's fine -- and that 's something that hangs with you your whole life really .
Right , right .
And over that , so --
Oh , bless your heart .
Where you from ?
You 've got an accent .
I do .
Tennessee .
Where are you from ?
I 'm from Illinois .
Oh , neat .
Yeah .
I 've almost give up on this thing .
I only had the one --
I know --
-- call and I could n't believe it when the phone rang and they said it was the Fisher project again tonight .
Well , that 's what -- this is my first one and I had -- I had forgotten all about it and I 'm like , " What in the world is this ? " you know .
