I am against the USG preventing the teaching of any book , even a stupid book filled with lies , to children .
I pity the children whose parents send them to christo-madrassa , but I support their right to be stupid , anti-liberal , deceitful vermin .
No tax breaks for churches .
No tax breaks for church donations .
No ban on priests talking politics .
No cognizance , whatsoever , of Religion by the Government !
See James Madison 's Memorial and Remonstrance against Religious Assessments ( second sentence from end of the paragraph numbered 1 ) and this snippet from Vice President Richard Mentor Johnson from an 1829 Senate Committee report on why we have mail delivery on Sundays ( more on the same here in " Review of a Report of the Committee , to Whom was Referred the Several Petitions on the Subject of Mails on the Sabbath Presented to the United States Senate , January 16 , 1829 by the Hon .
Mr. Johnson of Kentucky , Chairman of Said Committee " )
