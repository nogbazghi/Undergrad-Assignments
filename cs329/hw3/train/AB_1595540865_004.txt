Will Scarlet is in prison and dictating his story to a monk who seeks to discover information on Rhi Bran y Hud for his master Abbot Hugo .
Through Will 's memory we learn the latest news of Prince Bran 's exploits .
He and his men have become experts at stealing from the rich and giving back to the poor people of Elfael .
Will Scarlet tells how he found Prince Bran and joined up with him .
As always , Prince Bran 's only goal is to take care of his people and get his land back .
As Will retells his story to the monk , he becomes aware of a conspiracy that threatens King William the Red 's throne .
If he can get word to Prince Bran , there might be a way to save King William 's reign and get Elfael back .
But Will is sentenced to be hung soon .
How can a dead man get a message to anyone ?
I enjoyed Scarlet very much .
The second book was a much better read than the first .
It did have a long take from the old woman , but it was n't as frustrating as it was in the first book .
I also liked the way this book was written from Will 's perspective in prison .
Will is a wonderful character with a unique voice .
Lawhead switches point of view characters often , but to have the tale from Will was refreshingly consistent .
I highly recommend this second book .
It could be enjoyed without having read the first one .
