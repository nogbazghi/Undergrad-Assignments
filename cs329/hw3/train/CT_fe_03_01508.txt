Right , right .
So , is your friend okay now ?
Is he doing better ?
Yeah , he 's -- he 's almost -- I mean it was ironic because the kidney he got was almost like a perfect match for him .
Like a lot of times , you know , they -- you -- your body can reject th - -- you know , somebody else 's organ but in his case they were amazed .
They just thought that , um , the person may have been related to him it was so close .
I mean they could n't tell him who it came from but , uh --
Really ?
-- they were able to let him , like , write a letter to the family --
Oh good .
I was gonna ask that .
-- just thank 'em and stuff like that .
And they just , uh , gave to 'em like anonymous - anonymously but , uh --
Oh good .
Yeah , so that 's something that I -- I always think about every time I -- I see him .
Yeah .
That is something .
It 's something I think a lot of people think about and even today , like , with the fact that there 's a war and , you know --
Right .
-- the terrorist in itself that people just continuously , like , can relate to what actually happened to us 'cause , I think , uh , Americans themselves underestimate what --
Right .
-- what we -- how powerful we really are --
Right .
-- and how a simple , like , blink can take away so -- so much --
Yeah .
-- and that we 're not as powerful because , you know , we 're -- we 're weaker than we probably think we are .
Right .
So , do you have any friends over -- across seas or anything or ... ?
No, uh-uh .
I had -- only had one friend who was in the military but he 's -- he 's back .
He was in Japan for a little while --
Oh okay .
-- but now he 's back here .
Oh good .
You know , one thing I did , uh , think of too --
Mhm .
-- uh , just , uh , on another topic which is , I think , the one thing that has happened is , um , flying habits .
Yes .
You know , like right afterwards , you know , I did n't fly for a while --
Mhm .
-- um , I 've -- I 've gotten back to flying regularly now but I know that I 'm just , I guess , how earl- -- how often or ho- how early I get to the airport stuff like that .
Mhm .
That has changed .
Right .
Um , and also , um , I guess being a little bit more , like , alert or , you know , it 's funny 'cause the first time flew after that , like , I could just feel that everybody 's on the plane like looking at everybody else like , " Mm" .
Yeah .
You know what I mean like ... ?
