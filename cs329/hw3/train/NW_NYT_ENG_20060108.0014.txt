The Pistons may indeed be on a pace to win 70
games , but the man who put this group together , Detroit
hoops boss Joe Dumars , says such thinking is ludicrous .
" Trying to win 70 games is absolutely nothing we talk about
around here , " Dumars said by e-mail .
" It 's ridiculous to be
talking about winning 70 games .
Our only goal here is
to try and win the NBA championship and nothing else . "
He 's right , of course .
Think Tommy Heinsohn would n't trade a few
of the 68 wins he led the Celtics to in
1972-73 for the NBA title that eluded them that season ?
At the time , the 68 wins matched the second-most in
NBA history , behind only the 69-win Lakers team of the
year before .
But the Celtics went down to the Knicks in seven games
in the conference finals , losing Game 7 at Boston Garden .
One reason the Celtics did n't make it : John Havlicek injured
his shoulder .
Dumars has no such worries at present .
The Pistons ' vaunted starting five have started every game this season
and , dating back to their championship season of 2003-04 , Chauncey
Billups , Rip Hamilton , Tayshaun Prince , and Ben Wallace have missed
a total of 25 games .
Prince has yet to miss
a game and Wallace 's eight DNPs last year were the
result of a suspension ( six games ) and a death in
the family ( two ) .
