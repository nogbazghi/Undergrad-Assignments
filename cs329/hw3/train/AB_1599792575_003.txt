Rubin seems to advocate a Kosher diet - there is nothing wrong with the cloven hoof in modern times - all animals raised for food today are "fed " feed - like corn or pellets - swine do not forage for food in farmer browns trash - nor are they fed trash , ( except of course - China where all factory farmed animal are fed trash and even human fecal matter ) .
A better book is eat right for your type - this book promotes a kosher diet ( what would you expect from someone named Rubin and a publisher name siloam ( IE old Jersulam ) ) & the latest trends in health ..nothing new here . . except it heavily hawks his outrageously priced products - his green drink "perfect food " says "tastes great " - are you kidding ?
this stuff tastes like any barley grass green drink - horrid . . these books are being given away everywhere - I hope nobody has actually bought this book . .
