I read this book prior to a long weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country .
The book is very clearly written ( I almost finished it on a flight from Amsterdam to New York ) but it presents all the key facts and concepts - in a sympathetic but unbiased way .
Having read this book prior to my visit , I could have conversations with locals and feel closer to them thanks to the information and concepts picked up from this book .
I highly recommend it to anyone who plans to visit the Amish part of the country and look a little deeper than horse-driven carts and beards without moustaches .
