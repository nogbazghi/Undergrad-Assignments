As I read the reviews of others for See Jane Hit , I noticed that the reviewers came from either the academic side of the fence or the "in the field " side of the fence .
I would like to offer a perspective from both sides in the hope that we can look at Garbarino 's work from a more balanced perspective .
Having taught graduate counseling courses since the 1970 's and being a contemporary of Dr. Garbarino , I can tell you that his research skills and body of work in the field of adolescent psychology is highly respected by academia .
Both Lost Boys and See Jane Hit are considered classics in the field .
I had training with Dr. Garbarino in 2008 , and can say that he has consistently updated the statistics that continue to show a marked increase in violence among girls .
Also , having worked in K-12 public education for over 30 years ( and for the last ten in a program for at-risk adolescents ) , I can attest to the fact that violence among girls is increasing just as Dr. Garbarino warned .
But , past the "warnings , " go to the suggestions regarding "what we can do about it " and read carefully how he outlines the positives .
It is actually a "hopeful " book from a professional who has made his life 's work the positive development of adolescents !
