This canister vacuum cleans things very well .
It has really good suction for the size it is .
The only thing is the hose is rather 'stiff ' but I am hoping it loosens up as I use it .
It is really good on picking up 'sand' , dirt , hair , and fuzz .
It works great on laminate flooring and vinyl .
I would n't really recommend it for carpet though other than maybe for 'spot ' pick up .
