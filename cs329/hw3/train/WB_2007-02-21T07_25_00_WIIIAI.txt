Cheney , on his way to practice the art of diplomacy in Japan ( poor Japan ) ,
gave a speech aboard the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk , stationed in Tokyo , because the only audiences who will still put up with his shit are 1 ) captive military audiences , 2 ) who canât walk out without falling into the water and going âsplash .â 
They do look like theyâre weighing that option very seriously , though .
He told them âthe American people will not support a policy of retreat .â 
He told them â We want to complete the mission , we want to get it done right , and we want to return with honorâ  and they replied âSir !
Who is this âweâ  of whom you speak , sir !â 
He told ABC that the British decision to withdraw some troops from Iraq with honor , or possibly honour , was actually âan affirmation of the fact that there are parts of Iraq where things are going pretty well .â 
He called the Congressional resolution on the war âposturing on Capitol Hill , â  said that âitâs important to remember that this is a Sense of the Congress resolution , that it does nât have any binding impact or effectâ  and complained that Senate Republicans were not allowed to present their resolution that would nât have had any binding impact or effect .
He said of that , âSo thereâs a certain amount of politics involved , I suppose .â 
He then went on to accuse Nancy Pelosi and Jack Murtha of having a âpolicy of defeatâ  and validating Al Qaida strategy .
Asked about McCainâs recent criticism of Rumsfeld , Cheney said , â I think Donâs a great secretary [sic] .â 
He also said that McCain is a big pussy : âJohn said some nasty things about me the other dayâ  [i .e . , that Bush listens to Cheney too much ] âand then next time he saw me , ran over to me and apologized .
Maybe heâll apologize to Rumsfeld .â 
Giuliani : âWith a campaign built on traditional 9/11 values , and with the help of every citizen who believes in the 9/11 dream , I want to make 9/11 great again .â 
Al Kamen informs us that John Bolton is working on a book , but that it has no title .
I believe that means itâs time for a CONTEST !
YAY !
