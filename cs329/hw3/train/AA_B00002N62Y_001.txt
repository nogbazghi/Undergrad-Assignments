I have been using my Eureka 5843 for over 7 years .
The original belt just burned up this past week , and that was not because of poor design , or product quality .
My wife drops the vacuum down to the lowest setting , meant to be used on hardwood floors and tiles , even on shag and pile rugs .
After putting up with the added strain and friction caused by this type of use , the belt overheated and smoked , after 7+ years !
This is not the manufacturer 's fault , nor does it indicate poor quality on the vacuum or belt 's behalf .
All equipment relies on the user 's ability to read and follow the included instructions .
