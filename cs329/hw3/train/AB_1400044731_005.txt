I 'm in a Book Club for retired teachers so our monthy selections are on varied topics to say the least .
We had just finished reading a book about World security .
I was speaking to my daughter , who is a professor in Scotland , about our newest book when she asked me if I had read " Suite Francaise " .
This fasinated me after she gave me some of the author 's background.This book was written during the war while the author was living in France .
The characters are ficticious ,representing different classes at the time .
She decribes how it was living in France during that time when the government did not tell the people what was going on until it was too late and they tried to run for their lives .She invites us into each character 's life and follows at least 3 whose families come from different stations in life .
How she wrote this book , discribed these peoples reactions from all over France when she was n't even in many parts of France is amazing .
Reading her Bio first is a must .
