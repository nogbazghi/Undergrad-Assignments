I was disappointed with these tongs , which was surprising since OXO makes good kitchen utensils .
I agree with other reviewers , it is difficult to grasp and close them .
Unless you have a rather large hand ( which I do n't ) , you 're forced to grasp the handle so far down near the stainless steel !
When comparing these to my 12 " tongs my hand grasp was at the same point - which really made these 16 " tongs no different from the 12 " ones .
