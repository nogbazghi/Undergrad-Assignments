Cox News Service ATLANTA -- The Dow Jones industrial average , which
ended 2005 slightly in the red , came roaring back Monday
to close above 11,000 for the first time in 4
1/2 years .
Street 's oldest and most famous stock market index , which flirted with
11,000 on two occasions last year , delivered for investors this
time .
It gained nearly 53 points to close at 11,011.90 .
The Dow 's advance brings the famous index of 30 blue chip
stocks in line with the broader market , which moved to
new 4 1/2 year highs late last year .
That makes 11,000 more than just a symbolic , round number because
it reinforces the forecast that the 3-year-old bull market is
alive and well , and not likely to turn sour in
2006 .
" It 's more important that the Dow broke into a new high
rather than what the specific number is , " said Atlanta analyst
Gary Tapp .
The Dow has been a laggard in the market , since other
sectors such as technology and smaller and midsize stocks --
measured by other indexes -- had a good year in
2005 .
" The Dow was being dragged down by health care stocks .
This
looks like a pretty broad-based advance , " added Tapp , a quantitative
analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey .
The market value of all stocks -- shares outstanding multiplied by
price -- has risen $ 1.3 trillion since the Dow 's previous
close above 11,000 on June 7 , 2001 .
That is a
gain of 9.4 percent , according to the Dow Jones Wilshire
5000 index .
Monday 's gains by all the stock indexes also gave the market
a hefty advance during the first five trading sessions of
the new year , which in Wall Street folklore is supposed
to mean that investors can look forward to a positive
year in stocks .
As for why Monday , investors can especially thank embattled General Motors ,
one of the 30 Dow companies .
Shares of the world 's
biggest automaker surged almost 8 percent on some positive analyst
forecasts and upbeat company statements at the North American International
Auto Show .
While the Dow is still more than 700 points below its
all-time closing high , it represents a big comeback from one
of the worst bear markets in Wall Street history , which
hit bottom in October 2002 .
The Dow has rebounded by 3,726 points , or 51 percent , since
that market bottom .
The Dow first closed above 11,000 on May 3 , 1999 , just
five weeks after closing above 10,000 for the first time
on March 29 -- an event that got substantially more
attention .
The index 's all-time high of 11,722.98 on Jan . 14 , 2000 , came
and went without much fanfare , caught as it was in
the euphoria of a bull market many had begun to
think would never end .
It did end two months later
when the technology sector collapsed , bringing an end to the
dot-com era .
Going forward , the outlook for stocks this year is positive , but
moderate by most standards .
As Tapp sees it , " 2006 is looking like a year when
the two major headwinds that had been holding the market
back -- high energy prices and Federal reserve rate increases
-- are probably easing . "
Many strategists believe the Federal Reserve will raise its short-term federal
funds rate another quarter-point to 4.5 percent at its Jan .
31 policy meeting , and then stop .
Others speculate that , depending
on the economic numbers , it might add another quarter-point to
4.75 percent in March but go no further .
Either way , the end seems in sight after a series of
13 interest rate increases that started in June 2004 .
Further
rate increases are deemed unnecessary , since economists look for slower
economic growth to diminish inflation pressures .
For investors , strategists are also optimistic that corporate profits , which significantly
impact the stock market , will continue to expand at double-digit
rates well into the year .
Thomson Financial , which tracks Wall Street forecasts , looks for a 13
percent gain in 2006 , or about the same as in
2005 .
