This is my first immersion blender , but I am impressed with its capabilities so far .
I do like the multi-speed options and it seems to be a sturdy little instrument .
The packaging , however , is a crime against the earth ! !
I would never have bought it , had I known that it came sandwiched between two huge nonbiodegradeable slabs of styrofoam .
This aspect of the product seriously brings down its star rating in my book .
Amazon , you too , put on an offensive packaging show .
The KitchenAid box was packed in a huge box , many times larger than the purchased product , and stuffed with non-recyclable plastic .
:(
