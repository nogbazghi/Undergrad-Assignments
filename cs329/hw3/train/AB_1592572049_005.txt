An easy read from the begining .
IT details events that shaped the pathway to World War II and the rise and fall of the Third Reich and how they managed to defeat themselves .
It also proves a EXTREMLY important point as to the reason why we SHOULD get invloved in foreign affairs and not let them escalate .
It discusses how Hitler wanted to shape Europe into his empire and how backstabbing the Russians were and so forth .
It is detailed in a lot of places but I would have preffered more pictures and a little more details in some aspects .
I recommend this book to anyone either just getting into the events of World War II or need some more facts about it .
