You know , here he is backing up , you know , a fifty three foot trailer with God knows what in it --
Right .
Right .
-- and , you know -- and they 're accepting his freight and they do n't know what it is , and so he scribbles something on a piece of paper that they assume is his name , but they do n't always ask for an ID.
Mhm .
Mhm .
Or even if they say , you know -- they tell him all the time , " Write your driver 's license number on there " .
Well , he does n't give out that kind of personal information .
Right .
So , he makes up a number .
Uh-huh .
You know ?
Has your sister had to take off her shoes yet ?
My niece has .
Has she told you about ... ?
Yes .
Yes .
Oh , my goodness .
Oh , I was so upset about that .
Right .
The first time it happened to me I was like , oh , my goodness .
Do I even have on decent socks ?
I just thought that was so crazy .
Right .
I was beyond upset .
Like , are my toes gonna be sticking out now or ... ?
You know ?
Right .
You know ?
And they tell you that all the time , " If you have on anything other than tennis shoes take your shoes off" .
Right .
What ?
I mean , I just think that is so crazy .
That is just --
Right .
-- ridiculous .
I do n't understand these people .
I really do n't .
Like , it makes me want to write to law makers and just ask , you know , " Do you have anything else to be concerned about ? "
" What were you people thinking ? "
Yes .
I know .
Just is there something else for you to be concerned about rather than ...
Right .
Right .
It makes me wonder are you really doing because you 're so stupid , or is there something I 'm missing why you 're doing this , that I just do n't understand these absurd things you 're looking for ?
Right .
Right .
Like , what is this that -- you know , maybe with the whole little color coding thing had more to do with it .
Hold on a sec.
You 've got to wait a second .
Hello ?
Uh-huh .
Okay .
Maybe the whole color coding thing has more to do with airport security that we do n't know about or something .
Right .
I do n't know .
I 'm just like , oh , my gosh !
I think ...
Mhm .
And like , I -- I 'm a teacher and a lot of my kids do n't wanna fly .
Like , I teach se- --like seniors in high school .
Uh-huh .
It 's nearly about the time for them to be thinking about their -- their school -- their senior class trip --
