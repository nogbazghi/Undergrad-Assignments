I owned the original Sanyo little red vacuum and used it for 10 years ( I think ) .
I would still be using it but I loaned it to a friend who is having trouble giving it back .
I was so happy to get the updated version !
It works perfect for my wood , tile and linoleum floors , also on floor rugs .
It 's quiet , has excellent suction and it 's a workhorse that will last a long , long time !
