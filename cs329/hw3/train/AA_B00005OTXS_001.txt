Basically , the FOODSAVER system is sound and well designed EXCEPT for the canisters which often crack .
Many of us have urged Tilia to upgrade the plastic canisters , and so far they have refused .
I do not put the canisters in the dishwasher , or even use harsh chemicals .
One canister cracked , pressurized , on the shelf after a few weeks without being moved .
When you call Tilia they will let you know that there is NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND on their canisters , which tells volumes about how they view their own product .
Tilia blames their customers for the cracks .
I am honestly sorry I did not heed the warnings I read by Amazon consumers before I purchased .
I usually depend on Amazon customer recommendations for all my purchases .
I have spent much money on Tilia accessories , and am now considering looking for another brand .
Hope this helps , Ron
