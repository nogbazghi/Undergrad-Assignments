An entertaining , historically solid introduction to the Civil War for 4th graders and over ( a history teacher 's review ) , June 11 , 2009
I just discovered this series and I 've been reading a few of them for fun this summer .
" You Would n't Want to Be a Gladiator.. . " is entertaining and it contains solid , accurate history presented in a visually interesting format .
While I 've been looking a few of these over for my own personal entertainment , my almost 4th grade daughter has been sneaking them out of the stack and reading them without any encouragement from me .
Imagine !
Kids surreptitiously reading history !
The book details the life of a gladiator that is captured as a slave in battle in Gaul .
We follow him to his sale in the market and what kind of jobs he might have been sent to ( in the mines , as a galley slave , on the farm , etc. ) .
The slave is sent to gladiator school and we learn about their training , what they ate , the different types of gladiators and how they were punished .
We learn about different types of gladiator fights and how gladiator fights were generally organized .
Well done .
It should be a welcome part of any Rome unit from 4th grade and up .
