This is a great book .
I use it as a reference for putting formulas into my investment spreadsheets .
It would be a good read , if you can reading a mathematics book enjoyable , in order to become familiar with the concepts behind probability , risk , and measuring return on an investment or portfolio .
As already stated , I just use it as reference material - but I find myself going to it again and again .
