Square is hard to find but certainly stores better than all those stupid round bowls , lidded or not .
Glass is superior to any plastic and stuff just keeps better . . since these can go into the oven/microwave , saves on washing .
As to the fit , I have all three sizes and the lids are just fine for glass .
I also have vintage ones and the lids are n't airtight on them either .
Vintage ones made by Pyrex are somewhat smaller , come in colors , and not as heavy IF you can find them .
...although I do not know why the smallest size in these new ones has to be so expensive .
