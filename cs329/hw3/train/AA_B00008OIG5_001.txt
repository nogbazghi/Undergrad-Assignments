I checked out several stick vacs before purchasing the Miele S163 but did n't see any that seemed to compare in quality .
Great for hardwood floors , fine for small pickups on carpet .
Works really well on stairs and is very quiet .
However , the loop designed to hold the plug to the cord when it is wound for storage has too small an opening to allow the cord to enter .
I just simply wrap the plug end around the wound cord .
Beyond that would just be the expense .
