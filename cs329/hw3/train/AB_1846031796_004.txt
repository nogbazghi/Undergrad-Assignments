Albatros fighters made up the backbone of the German Air Service in World War I. Most , if not all of Germany 's aces , flew some version of the sleek Albatros craft during their combat careers .
The exploits of Albatros aces were so widespread that Osprey Publishing has produced a second volume on Albatros aces , this one authored by Greg VanWyngarden .
VanWyngarden 's book differs from the earlier book , written by Norman Franks , in that he covers many of the lesser known Albatros aces not covered previously .
Ernst Udet is probably the best known ace described along with the likes of Max Muller , Julius Buckler , Kurt Student , Theodor Rumpel , Kurt Schonfelder , Karl-Emil Schafer and others .
VanWyngarden is a gifted author , his text flowing smoothly .
He includes several first-person accounts that help give a human flavor to those long-ago dogfights .
The text is complimented by 100 black & white photographs , several plan views and 11 pages of color profiles by Harry Dempsey .
World War I enthusiasts will want to purchase this book .
It compliments and supplements the earlier Franks book with more tales of intrepid aces flying one of the sleekest fighters of the Great War .
