Calfornia is not usually my favorite setting for books and I passed the first time I saw this book at my local Borders .
Upon second review I decided to give it a shot and I am very glad that I did .
The plot and characters draw you in and you become interested in them .
Karp throws as good a curve ball as they throw in this genre .
This book has heart .
