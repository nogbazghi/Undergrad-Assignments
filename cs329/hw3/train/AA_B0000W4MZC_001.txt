When I received my 2 thermostates I was pleased to see that they were within 2 degrees of each other .
Easy to read although the one in the freezer does fog up a bit when you open the door .
Easy to hang on wire racks or set on a shelf .
i was able to hang mine in the freezer , but had to sit it on the shelf in the refrigerator .
It is nice to know that the freezer and refrigerator are within safe limits .
Oh and they also look to be very well made and durable
