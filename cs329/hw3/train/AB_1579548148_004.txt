This is the only diet that I have ever been able to lose weight on .
My favorite part is that you lose it fast and it comes off the belly first !
The first phase might seem tough and a little boring at first , but after a few days you will be in love with it !
I was amazed to see that only after the first week I completely lost all my cravings for junk food including my favorites : pizza and ice cream !
I only wanted to eat healthy food , especially veggies , which usually made me gag before .
My only complaint is that this diet is a little expensive and requires a lot of cooking , but I am about to buy some of the other South Beach Diet books which I have heard have less expensive options and less cooking .
I would definitely recommend this diet because it does n't just cut calories like most diets , it 's actually healthy , and it is a scientific diet in the way it is designed to fix your blood sugar and re-train you to make healthier choices .
