This is an interesting book that proves how reflective combat performance can be in influencing things at home .
The book is divided into two parts , first is the story on the Japanese American experiences during World War II on the home front , one of the great national shames in our nation 's history .
Second story lies with the combat units of 442nd and 100th , all made up with Japanese Americans .
The key element of this book lies with the fact that the superb performances of these two Japanese American combat units clearly affected how their kinfolks were regarded and treated at the home front .
As the two combat units ' performances became superior , the book clearly show how official and unofficial restrictions , racial suspicions and rancor toward their families and friends at home all lessen to considerable degree .
The author managed to create a " cause and effect " between the Japanese American combat units and the home front from where those men hailed from .
It does rise a question - if those two Japanese American combat units were lousy cowardly units without any redeeming values , would the restrictive treatments of Japanese American at home be so easily lifted even after the war ?
In this case , the author of this book clearly marked the Japanese Americans along the same line as the black troops who also fought pretty well for our nation and thus led to the road of desegregating the military .
As we all know , desegregating the military was the first step of the civil right movement of the late 1950s and 1960s .
Overall , a very interesting and sobering book on how racially segregated military forces can changed the attitude of many by their valor and sacrifices made on the field of battle .
