Proponents of the all-Alaska natural gas project say one reason for
backing their proposed pipeline from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez is
to avoid running the line through Canada to reach Lower
48 markets .
They say you just ca n't trust what our
hockey-playing neighbors might do .
They could decide to tax our
gas , or change the rules for pipeline construction or operation .
Or take some of the construction jobs .
And what if Canada had a snit and threatened to stop
the flow of gas ?
Well , you can set aside that paranoia for a minute .
No
matter what you may think of our neighbors , at least
they never drew up a war plan to attack us .
Too bad the United States ca n't say the same thing .
The Washington Post reported last week that the U.S. military approved
a secret plan in 1930 to invade , conquer and take
over Canada -- just in case .
It seems the plan
started in the late 1920s as a precaution -- just
in case we got into a trade war with England
and needed to take down Canada before the British could
use it to launch attacks on U.S. soil .
Maybe Canadians 125 years ago -- when they first sang the
words to " O Canada " -- had a hint that goofy
Pentagon planners might someday look north and see a target .
The last line of the song , which later became the
national anthem , is : " O Canada , we stand on guard for
thee . "
The bottom line : It 's a good thing Canadians have a sense
of humor about Americans .
