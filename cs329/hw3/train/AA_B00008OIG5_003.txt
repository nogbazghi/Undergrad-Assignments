I own a Miele canister vac as well and always used it on my wood floors with the floor attachment .
Then I was talked into buying this cute green stick vac so I would always have a floor vac "ready to go " ( I do a lot of floor cleaning with 3 boys ! ) .
Well , it worked fine for about 6 months , then some metal pieces popped out on the head while I was using it and scratched my floor badly .
The vacuum is also heavy and does n't lean easily against things ; mine slipped down and promptly cracked the plastic floor attachment .
Miele vacuums vacuum well but their plastic is defective .
I 've owned slightly cheaper Kenmore 's that vacuum almost as well but are a lot more durable .
Also , you CAN disconnect the wand from the body and use it as a hand vac , but it is very heavy .
