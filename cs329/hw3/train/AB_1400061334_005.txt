As pointed out by several other reviewers , this book is a sequel to the earlier and better Imperial Grunts .
Kaplan revisits some of the locales of the earlier book and reports tremendous progress in places like Columbia and the Philippines .
He spends time on a nuclear carrier , a destroyer and a nuclear fast attack submarine .
Those were the best parts of the book .
He spends time with A 10 pilots on deployment to Thailand and provides well-deserved credit to these blue collar fighter pilots who fly the unloved but tremendously valuable attack aircraft .
It was so unloved by the fighter mafia that runs the US Air Force that they were going to retire the plane .
The Army , which depends on air support , and has no air wing of its own like the Marine Corp , offered to take over the plane and add it to its own air arm .
The Air Force quickly restored the A 10 units to full flying status and no more was heard for a while about retiring them .
Kaplan does travel a lot and the depth of his interviews in the earlier book is n't here but it is still a good source of information about the far flung US military as it fights the savage wars of peace .
