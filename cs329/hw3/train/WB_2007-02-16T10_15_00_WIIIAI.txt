A spokesmodel for Gen . Qanbar went on Iraqi state television to brag that âonlyâ  ten murdered corpses were found in Baghdad last night .
Hurrah !
A Venezuelan court imposed a fine of $ 20,000 or so on an opposition newspaper after a humor writer wrote a parody of a conversation between Hugo Chavez and his 9-year old daughter , whose privacy the writer is accused of violating by writing fictional dialog for her , following a Chavez speech in which he recounted how his daughter complained about the horse in the nationâs coat of arms galloping towards the right , which was subsequently changed .
Speaking of privacy , as in âright of ,â  Tennessee state rep Stacey Campfield ( a man ) has introduced a bill to require death certificates for aborted fetuses , thus putting the names of their mothers into the public record .
Campfield ( a white man ) was last seen attempting to join the legislatureâs Black Caucus , saying that the KKK has âless racist bylawsâ  than it does ( he did nât get in )( to the Black Caucus , I mean , not the KKK) .
Oh , and heâs also a blogging white man .
