I read great reviews about this book but found it very disappointing .
There were many opportunities for the Dr. to offer more practical advice but it was often overshadowed by Lisa 's unnecessary fantasy details .
There were many issues with this family that the book glossed over , particularly along the lines of the Dr. not wanting to tell others about Lisa 's pregnancy out of fear of upsetting his daughter .
Also there was the issue of the bond between Lisa and her son that was never really addressed .
In many ways it seems as if they learned how not to tackle the issues ( i .e .
Lisa and the Dr. sleeping on seperate floors so their children could maintain a sense of the exclusivity of their previous lives without the blended family ) but to mitigate them through avoidance .
I was frustrated with the intimate details of what kind of outfit the baby wore or how many plates were set for Christmas dinner .
The new baby that was created between them seemed to have been created as a business arrangement in some ways .
Not quite what I was looking for and disappointing since so many swear by this book .
