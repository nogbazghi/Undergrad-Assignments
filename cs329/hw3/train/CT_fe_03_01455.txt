Mhm .
Because without that sense of community it , it 's very difficult , and I think you probably see a lot of that within your own town .
Right .
Because of the sense of community there --
Yeah , 'cause , I mean --
-- there 's a stronger unity , and , um you can , you can trust and rely on more people that way .
Right .
So... but like I said , you know , um , I do n't think my life really has changed much since then , um , I mean , I was on a plane going across the country not but , you know , four weeks after September eleventh , so , um , the flight really did n't bother me , because I guess I figured , you know , if it 's my time to go it is --
Mhm .
-- and there 's nothing I can do to change that .
So , um , -- but , you know , it does , it does remind me that , you know , we 're not guaranteed tomorrow , and so I do have to live my life every single day to the best of my abilities , and , um , you know , I guess , I guess I try to keep a better eye on things that are happening around me , you know , if there 's any suspicious activity then I want to be aware of it and , you know , not , um , not go around , I guess , um , totally absorbed within myself , so...
Mm .
Yeah .
All of the , the -- I mean , I think now that , ah , you know , I -- 'cause I guess a lot of -- a lot of those terrorists that were on the plane , they were n't in the country legally .
Right .
And , ah , I mean , I think , I think I write my congressman more about , you know , enforcing immigration laws .
I think that plays a big role in it too .
Very true , very true .
You know , and I think , I think a lot of it , I think , as far as the country , like you said , you know , a lot of people are arrogant and they think it ca n't happen to them , but , you know , three thousand -- over three thousand people are learned that , you know , hey , it can happen to you .
Right .
So , I 'm very -- make the -- the whole country more conscious --
Right .
-- of what 's going on .
Right .
Instead of worrying about their car payment and stuff , you know .
Right right .
Putting their kids in --
Should I buy the boat or should I not , you know .
Yeah .
Yeah , I 'm out , should I -- should I buy a boat or buy some plastic and duct tape .
Right .
Which , you know , let me ask you if I can , you know , have you taken those kind of steps for your family , to buy things that you think would be necessary around your home in case there were a terrorist attack around your area ?
