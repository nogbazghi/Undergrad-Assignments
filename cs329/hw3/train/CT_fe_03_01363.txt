Oh , okay .
Near B.C.
So yeah , and I just was gonna say like , uh , one of our school districts here has , uh , there 's been a big going on and on battle with , uh , banning , um , books on +homosexuality , you know , like -- like the lesbian -- the books -- I guess some parents have , uh , obviously there is parents out there , there 's children out there that are , but , um , they 've , th - for whatever reasons the school board has thought that -- that the children should n't be allowed to read these books , right ?
Is it grade school or high school or ?
Grade school .
Mm .
Elementary , yeah .
The lower grades .
And , uh , does it talk about actual , uh , I mean , se- sexual things ?
No, no , it 's just like -- like , it 's like a -- like a -- a grade three four little reader , you know , like it 's -- and it 's I 've Got Two Moms , or I 've Got Two Dads and
Oh , and
This kind of thing .
And -- and it 's , um , it 's a -- it 's quite a bit of controversy here because -- because some people -- like , when either you really believe o - or you really believe whichever way , right ?
Like --
Right .
-- and it 's -- and it 's getting -- the school board is , um , and then it becomes political , right ?
Like --
Oh yeah .
-- like the way to get voted in again and all this stuff , so
Yeah , whenever politics gets into it , it 's just --
Yeah , like it 's --
-- crooked .
Yeah .
Around here anyway .
Yeah , yeah , I 'm sure it 's all over .
But -- but , uh , it -- it 's -- it 's hard to -- you sit and listen , right ?
And just 'cause it does n't -- does n't affect you personally does n't -- I mean , at the moment it does n't affect you personally .
Right .
Right ?
Like -- like , uh , but -- but it -- it 's -- it 's interesting how , um , somebody gets their mind set on something and it just -- they go with it , and -- and , uh , sometimes they win .
Mhm .
Because these books have been banned , which , I think , how are the kids gonna find out if it -- if -- if -- if , uh , there 's biased parents that want it banned , then -- then they 're gonna give th - their children a biased opinion , and -- and the kids will never know the truth .
They 're -- they 're bringing their children up in such a narrow world .
I belie- yeah , yes , it 's a --
And everything 's not one way .
No.
There is two sides to every situation --
To everything .
-- and --
Yes , yeah .
It just , uh , reading , I think , expands your mind , and it just teaches you so much .
Oh --
