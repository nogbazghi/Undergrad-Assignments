Dick Cheney spoke to the 34th annual Conservative Political Action Conference this evening .
He did nât say anything interesting , so I donât have anything interesting to say about what he said , and running these amusing pictures of the Dickster ( one of them taken by a clearly bored Reuters photographer trying to make him look like heâs wearing a huge American flag skirt ) feels a little bit like skipping the vegetables and going straight to the dessert .
Well all right , but just this once .
