I 'm sorry I do n't share the enthusiasm of previous reviewers about this book .
I borrowed it at the library because I liked the cover ( by the way , I looked in vain in the book for a reference to the jacket illustration ) and I was intrigued to read a plot about Justinian 's and Theodora 's court .
I found the book hard to read because it 's not well written ( and has many typos ) , it 's difficult to get attached to any single one of its many characters , and the style of the descriptions really failed to put me in the picture .
Three religions are "described " in the book : Orthodox Christianity , Heretic Christianity , and Mithraism , but you 'll be hard pressed to know what each stands for after reading THIS book ...
I finished reading it only because I was hoping it would get better in the end--no such luck !
