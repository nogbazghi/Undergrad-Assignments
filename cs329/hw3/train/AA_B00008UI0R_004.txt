I truly hate this vacuum that my husband bought because it looked 'cool ' while it worked on both carpet and hardwood floor .
Here is a short list of why :
1 .
The belt that rotates the brush keeps slipping off .
After 10th time , my husband threw his hands up in utter defeat .
2.
I have difficult time dragging the canister part while vacuuming .
So many times , you are limited to the length of the flex hose connecting the two parts .
It gets frustrating after third time stopping to drag/carry the canister .
3.
The main brush/vacuum part does n't stand on its own .
So when I stop to bring the canister closer , I have to place it on the floor .
My back gets a lot of workout for the day .
For the most part , the vacuum stays in the closet because I dread using it .
My cordless vacuum has been overworking for our family with couple of dogs and a toddler for now .
If you are considering buying this , please go to your local store so if it does n't work out for you , too , you can easily return the product .
