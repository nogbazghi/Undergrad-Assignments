My wife is an Registered Nurse and I am a combat veteran .
I bought this book for my wife to take on our trip to Hawaii .
She could not put it down , and later , neither could I. From both our life experiences , this book rang true and was gripping .
Having been written by a Minnesotan made it all the more enjoyable .
