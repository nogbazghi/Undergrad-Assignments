Yeah .
Yeah , I -- I definitely agree with that , because I 've -- you know , I 've seen it happen .
Right .
Like I said , I think that 's more in the government and I -- I do n't know as far as like the military , um , I 'm not sure about that .
Um , I 've only seen it on the civilian side so I do n't know , you know , what the -- what the -- the military portion of that would be .
Right .
Um , and I -- I -- I do n't know -- I do n't know a way to , um , correct how it is now .
I mean , do you have any ideas on that ?
Oh , gosh , no .
