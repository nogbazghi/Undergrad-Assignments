I actually use these with a Rival Seal-a-meal vacumn sealer .
They work great every time .
They vacumn and seal easily .
I 've even re-used bags three and four times .
I hate to use more plastic , but love the results .
I try to salve my conscience by making sure I recycle all the bags when they 're no longer usable .
I 've tried using cheaper bags from Wal-Mart , and had nothing but trouble .
The Rival seal-a-meal bags actually work fine too , they 're just harder to find .
