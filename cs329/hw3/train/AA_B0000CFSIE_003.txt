I 've owned two pieces of Corningware for more than 40 years and they are still in use .
I was looking for some crock-type containers for reheating leftovers in the microwave , as well as cooking in the oven .
This is the best thing I 've seen for my purposes .
It holds enough to asemble an entire meal for one .
I bought 2 of the 23oz oval , and 2 of the 24oz round , and like them so well that I ordered two more of each .
I read somewhere that the lids are hard to get on and off , but I 've had no problem with mine .
If you save left-overs to use on another occasion this item is perfect .
