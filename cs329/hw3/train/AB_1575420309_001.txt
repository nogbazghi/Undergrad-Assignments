The study that was conducted , upon which this book is based , is very revealing .
The book defines 20 external and 20 internal assets that children need to succeed .
Our company has developed these ideas into worksheets and used them in treatment .
This book aides in better understanding these assets and how to address them .
Again , not great reading but very good content .
