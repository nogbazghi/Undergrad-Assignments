My 9 year old son is studying Rome as part of our unit study and I picked this book up because I thought that it looked interesting ... well , I completely underestimated it ! ! !
He devoured this and I believe that his independent research of Rome outside of " class " is a result of the clever illustrations and nibblets of information that come across in interesting ways throughout this book .
I went ahead and ordered the books on Pompeii and Roman Soldiers and he absorbed them with the same hunger and speed .
This is a series that we will be adding to our history studies for sure .
I could not recommend this more - it is fun and education , just what school should be !
