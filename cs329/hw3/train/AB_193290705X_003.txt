As a Line producer/ Unit Production Manager ( DGA ) in the film industry , I wish more first time directors - and even seasoned ones - had books like this sitting on their shelves .
They might learn a few more techniques about planning shots and informing the crew to make for a more efficient , cost-effective production .
That time and money could always be used to make the film better in another aspect .
Unfortunately , some directors believe that giving information to the Keys and the crew gives away their Directorial vision .
They are 'organic ' directors which means that they have the brains of a potato .
Sharing the vision gets a better vision from the Keys and the crew .
Worthwhile Reference .
