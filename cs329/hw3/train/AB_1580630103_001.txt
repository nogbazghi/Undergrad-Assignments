I started with Mr. Davich 's later book , "8 minute meditation " and enjoyed it so much that I sought this one out .
I was n't disappointed .
It is a comprehensive book on many forms of meditation .
And it is written in the clear , easy to understand manner that his other books are .
I really recommend this to anyone looking to deepen their knowledge of meditation .
