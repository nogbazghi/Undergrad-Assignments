Like , you know , people tend to , um , relax , you know , when there 's -- when nothing 's going on , you know , when --
Yeah .
-- uh --
But you ca n't live your life in fear , right ?
No.
You ca n't .
Of what might happen .
I think Washington , though , with the President being there --
Yeah .
-- is -- is -- is a lot more secure than , say , New York City would be .
Yes .
So , how are they going to pay for all this security ?
You know ?
Yeah .
The taxes , um , you know , they 're --
I do n't know .
President Bush is talking about planning to , you know , tax cuts .
Yeah .
I do n't know how he 's going to do it , like , where he 's coming up with the money .
I do n't know .
Or has he --
Well , he 's taken it away --
-- found a way to --
-- from other programs , I guess .
Yeah , the tax , the cigarettes .
I smoke , I --
Well --
I 've been buying my cigarettes on the internet .
Yeah , have you ?
They -- they -- they come from Switzerland .
From Switzerland ?
I pay fourteen dollars a carton as --
That 's --
-- opposed to forty dollars in -- in the st- you know --
Is that what they are now ?
Forty dollars a carton .
God .
Forty and change .
Yeah .
So --
I thought they were still , like , twenty something ?
No.
I mean , I -- I 'd have to give up smoking .
My gosh . .
That would be terrible .
Yeah .
Yeah .
I wish I could give it up , but I really do n't have the desire to , I guess .
Yeah .
So , I tried .
I had a pneumonia at one point and I tried and then when I felt well enough , I was back to smoking .
Mhm .
But anyway --
Yeah .
Has anything --
I ca n't think of what else .
You know , I -- I 've -- I do n't really want to travel , but I guess , you know , getting the gun and keeping my TV on a lot --
Yeah .
On -- on news stations , which I never watched before .
I think that 's probably something that I 'm doing more of since September eleventh .
Yeah .
I 'm more aware of , uh , uh , you know , keeping more in touch with news .
Right .
Yeah .
And -- and everything .
Now , how -- how did you first hear about September eleventh ?
I had the T- I actually had the TV on .
We -- yeah .
We actually did , too .
My husband , uh , used to --
I had the Today Show on --
-- like to watch --
-- and they showed the first plane hit and it 's , like , oh my gosh , what a horrible accident .
