I bought many of the OXO Good Grips kitchen gadgets for my wife to replace an assortment of older items that had just lost their looks , and so forth .
This stainless slotted spoon as with all of the OXO Good Grips items we bought feels great in your hand , is well made and looks great .
I would recommend the OXO Good Grips items to any of my family and friends , as a very nice home kitchen utensils set .
