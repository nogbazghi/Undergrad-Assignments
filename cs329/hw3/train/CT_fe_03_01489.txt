Right , I know the -- the first probably week , week and a half the TV was pretty much on CNN all the time but -- and while it was more interesting than what I remember in any other war watching news coverage I -- you know , it --
-- did n't really tell me anything more that was pertinent to me .
It was interesting to watch the embedded reporters , but I 'm sure that was n't the whole picture it 's just what they wanted us to see .
Yeah , I got that feeling a lot too and , you know , after September eleventh , you know , we had massive news coverage over one big event and that is about all you saw and then it made me mad that other issues were pushed aside , you know , um , they had the , ah , Gary Condit and Chandra Levy , you know , I saw a picture of him right after September eleven had happened , he was -- he was walking out of a court room smiling because they 'd -- they -- they were dropping charges against him .
Right , --
And that 's --
-- September eleventh pretty much -- his political career was over regardless , but it pretty much saved --
-- his personal life .
Yeah , yeah , and there 's a lot of other news stories that did n't get attention and , you know , it -- it also makes you wonder about the role that this country is going to follow because the initial reason that we went into Iraq was because of the connection to --
-- September eleventh , but now we 've got -- now they 're saying that it 's more of a humanitarian thing that , you know , we 're there to save the Iraqi people but there 's , you know , forty , fifty other countries that have dictators , you know , are we supposed go in there and play peace keeper as well --
Right .
-- and if we do n't ?
All I know I was watching a little bit of news tonight and saw the Iraqi people saying that we should either make their lives better today or get out and I think too many people expect in some of these foreign countries , you know , we command and have whatever the military action is and they expect their lives to be turned around by us a hundred per cent in a week or less .
Yeah , and --
You know , and they do n't -- they think just because we did whatever we did that we accept full responsibility in the rebuilding of their country .
But see that 's the other thing --
-- and that 's partly why September --
-- eleventh happened was because you have resentment --
Right .
-- especially in the Middle East because we 've helped Israel so much and Israel is not liked over there .
Right .
You 've got a strong Muslim population and Israel is Jewish and it 's mostly because of our support of Israel and a lot of our actions in other countries that have been covert and -- and , ah , detrimental to their governments that you 've got their people rising up against us .
