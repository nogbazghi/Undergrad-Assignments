I could not believe the difference this humidifier made to the quality of the air in my home .
If you have problems with dry air (especially in the winter time ) then you need one of these .
I run mine on medium or high speed which requires the tank to be filled twice in a 24-hour period .
The tank has two handles for easy carrying and filling .
I usually have to change the filter once a month or so ( I clean the base and tank every week ) .
This humidifier would be ideal in a large bedroom or living area .
As an added bonus Holmes includes a humidistat so you can monitor the humidity level in your home .
I use this reading to adjust the settings on the humidifier to keep the rooms more comfortable .
The only downside is the cost of the filters ( $ 15 ) .
Otherwise I highly recommend this product .
