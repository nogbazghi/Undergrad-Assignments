We know have 2 10 inch Analon Titanium skillets .
We like them all very much .
We had some earlier analon skillets and they are very good , but the titanium series is better .
An earlier Anolon skillet still is non-stick but is starting to lose something .
The titanium does not seem to be losing it .
Great skillets .
