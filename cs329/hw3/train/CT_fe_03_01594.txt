You know .
Yeah .
Because , you know , who 's to say that they could put something in there and somehow or other , it did n't get scanned or do -- do -- do all pieces of luggage get scanned through or do they just do random checks on luggage too ?
I do n't know , but I remember when I was flying at , um , you know , they had set up all these tables for pe- for them to go through everyone 's luggage , you know , like ran- like , random checks .
Right .
Through luggage .
Right .
And everything , but I do n't know , like , behind , you know , do they scan them 'em also ?
I do n't know .
No.
I do n't know --
-- if we 'll ever really feel as safe as we ever did , I do n't know whether we ever will , you know .
It 's like so many things can happen .
Mhm .
I really do n't care to fly any more I do n't believe .
I did go there , went to [inaudible ] with -- with -- I travelled with my daughter but , of course , I guess if anything 's going to happen , it can happen on a plane or anywhere else either .
Mhm , yeah , I think I 've flown -- flew twice .
Really ?
Yeah .
Since then or just --
I actually flew in October .
Oh , did you really ?
Yeah , right afterwards .
Oh , God , that would have scared me .
That really would have scared me .
I know I think shortly after that happened I believe my daughter did fly somewhere and it -- it -- it seemed like that 's all you 're thinking about .
Mhm .
You know .
I think what scared me more , I do n't mind all the additional searches and everything .
Uh-huh .
But what scared me was just seeing all the , um , is that there , ah , g- -- the guards with their , you know , guns and everything walking around .
Yeah , that would be -- that would be scary .
That was what scared me .
Yeah .
I 'm just not a big fan of guns .
So --
No.
Being that close .
I know it , I know it , I know .
I hope they -- I do hope they come up with something that 's foolproof so that people will feel comfortable again .
Mhm .
But until then , I guess the majority of us will still be taking our chances every time we go up in the air .
Yeah .
But I think every time you go up in the air , you 're taking your chances anyway .
Yeah .
It 's just like getting in a car though , you 're taking a chance when you go off in a car for that matter .
Yeah , I mean , it 's more a likelihood , right ?
Mhm .
I think air travel 's the safest .
Right , that 's what they say .
Yeah .
