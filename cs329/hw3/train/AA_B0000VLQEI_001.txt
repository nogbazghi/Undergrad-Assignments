Bought these tongs because I was tired of using the nylon/silicone tongs we 've had for ages and seeing all kinds of food items slip out of them .
These bamboo tongs have been fantastic .
The bamboo grain has an interesting ability to grip onto things .
Food items from bacon to chicken breasts to hot dogs can be picked up firmly without any concern that they will slip out or be dropped .
The length also means you can use them without fear of getting burned , although unless you have a pretty strong grip ( which my wife does not , it seems ) you still have to grip them a little more than halfway up .
( which means you 're not a full 11 " away from the hot pan . )
All in all though , in the short couple of months we 've had these I 've found myself reaching for them more often than our other cooking tongs .
Only think I do n't like : the brand sticker used on the top of the tongs left some sticky glue residue when it was removed .
Not a big deal - it 's easily removed with some goo-be-gone or similar .
