I 've been using the Food Saver system for several years .
It does a fine job of extending the expected shelf-life of stored foods .
The 1 quart bags are the size that are useful for a 2 party family .
These bags are very well made , and seal to perfection .
I may suggest one improvement ...the seal line should be more adjustable so that the bag could be reused a couple of times .
You should be able to cut off the bag at the seal point , reinsert a food , and reseal the bag .
I ca n't do this because too much of the bag is wasted after cutting off the first seal .
I have dealt with customer service a few times and they have been very accommodating , and have fully satisfied my needs .
