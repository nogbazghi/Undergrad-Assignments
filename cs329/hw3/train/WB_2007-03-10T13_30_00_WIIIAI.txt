In a press conference with Uruguayan President Tabare VÃÂ¡zquez , Bush said something that was entirely truthful : â I think many people in my country donât know that Uruguay is the leading exporter of software in South America .â 
He continued to search desperately for other tidbits in a failed attempt to make Uruguay interesting : â Interestingly enough , we both have gotten rid of colonial powers in our past , and it is -- I think it is that heritage that makes Uruguay and the United States such natural partners .â 
You could say the same thing about Zimbabwe or Burma or Cuba or the majority of nations in the world .
Hugo Chavez , speaking to a large rally just one country away in Argentina , referred to George as âthe little imperial gentleman from the northâ  and âa political corpse .â 
Bushâs Latin American tour has him scheduled to address no public crowds , of any size .
Funny , that .
A reporter asked Bush , â Hugo Chavez suggested that you are afraid to mention his name .
So , are you ?â 
In his response , Bush did not mention Chavezâs name .
To be fair , Chavez is a pretty scary fellow .
Asked about the FBI abuse of national security letters , Bush said , âMy question is , what are you going to do to solve the problem and how fast can you get it solved ?
And I was pleased by Director Muellerâs answer , that he had already begun to address some of the problems , but thereâs more work to be done .â 
Bush was pleased with that answer , arenât you pleased with that answer , knowing you can go about your business , safe in the reassuring knowledge that Robert Mueller has already begun to address some of the problems , but there is more work to be done .
