As an allergy and dry skin sufferer I needed something that offered quick relief .
The Holmes cool mist humidifer was something that delivered at a reasonable cost .
It is convenient to maintain and relatively quiet .
It is best to use it in your bedroom for maximum benefit , especially if you suffer from dry nasal passages .
My husband uses a C-Pap machine for his sleep apnea which has contributed to nasal passage dryness .
He immediately noticed a difference !
