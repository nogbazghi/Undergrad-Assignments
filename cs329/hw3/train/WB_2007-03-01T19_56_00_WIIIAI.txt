As mentioned in my last post , Bush visited Katrina-hit regions today .
âAnd so Iâve come back to New Orleans , Louisiana , to remind people that the federal government still knows you existâ .
Knows , yes ; cares , not so much .
Bush held a photo op at Samuel J. Green Charter School as part of his campaign to exploit the destruction of New Orleans to push his agenda to privatize public schools .
âIâm trying to lend my voice to herald this school , â  he heralded .
And he knows a lot about what makes a good school .
âThose are the two things I was good at at school , â  he said , âeating and playing .â 
Sure you were , George , sure you were .
AP caption to this picture : âPresident Bush , right , examines a plastic bottle terrarium as he visits a third grade class at the Samuel J. Green charter school in New Orleans , La. , Thursday , March 1 , 2007.â  ( Good thing they cleared up the confusion about whether President Bush was the middle-aged white guy or the little black boy . )
âNo , Mr. President , itâs a ter-ra-ri-um .
Try again .â 
âTuhrrooriun .â 
