Have had previous versions due to its great suction/cleaning .
Have 2 dogs and 2 todlers/babies , with one of them alergic to dog hair , thus need great cleaning .
This provides .
Prior versions had issues with durability in the hose connections and had replaced several times due to wearing out as you disconnect and reconnect often for using tools .
This one has a telescoping wand with a singular release and seems much more durable in the above problem area .
Only negative is that it lost a feture where you could turn down the suction by letting other air in and without this it makes doing things like drapes or small rugs much harder .
