John McCain was in Iraq today , complaining during a press conference in the Green Zone that Americans arenât getting the âfull pictureâ  from the media about how safe Iraq is now .
âNever have I been able to drive from the airport , never have I been able go out into the city as I was todayâ .
How did he ( and other congresscritters ) go out into the city ?
If you guessed wearing body armor , in armored vehicles , with helicopters flying overhead , accompanied by many , many soldiers , you guessed correctly .
Isnât that how everyone goes to market ?
The delegation went rug-shopping in the largest Baghdad market , where the AP notes that some sellers âwould not take money for their souvenirsâ .
With all those men with guns sweeping through their stalls , they probably thought it was a stick up .
[Update : Newsweek reports : ââ I bought five carpets for five bucks ,â  Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina gushed at a presser shortly after the visit .â 
Ah , the spoils of war !
That makes it all worthwhile . ]
I asked about the Iraqi police who participated in the massacres in Tal Afar .
Still no news , but their very existence is now being denied by the local American commander , Lt . Col . Malcom Frost , Military Moron : âAs we investigate this , thereâs no indication that this was an inside job ...
As much as we want war to be , it is not a zero-defect exercise , and unfortunately the enemy sometimes finds a seam .
This is the case in this incident .â 
He went on , âSometimes you must take half a step back to take two steps forward .â 
It is unclear if that half a step was the market bombing , which killed 152 , or the reprisal massacres of 50 to 70 ( such counts are highly political in Iraq , with Frost and the Tal Afar city government giving lower figures than the interior ministry ) .
Like McCain , M.M. Frost chided the media and told it to just grow up already : âIt is both foolish and immature to let this one event represent the progress Tal Afar has made .â 
