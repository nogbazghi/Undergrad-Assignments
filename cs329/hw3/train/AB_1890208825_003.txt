I agree with Ms. Mehl , whose excellent review of this book matches those of the other professional reviewers , from Publishers Weekly and Booklist , noted elsewhere on this page -- reviewers who , presumably , aim to offer informed , helpful opinions .
The novel is fascinating , with a wealth of detail and plot twists and an ending that is rather startling .
