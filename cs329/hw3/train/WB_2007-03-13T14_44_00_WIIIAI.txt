Alberto Gonzales called a press conference about the firings of those 8 US Attorneys , and the lies told to Congress about those firings , passive-voicedly acknowledged that âmistakes were madeâ  while refusing to admit that Congress was lied to ( â I believe very strongly in our obligation to ensure that when I provide information to the Congress that itâs accurate and that itâs complete , and I am very dismayed that that may not have occurred here â ) , insisted that the US attorneys were fired for being âweak performers ,â  absolved himself of responsibility ( âwhen you have 110,000 people working in the department , obviously there are going to be decisions made that Iâm not aware of in real timeâ ) , and uttered the most meaningless words a Bush cabinet official can ever utter : â I accept that responsibility .â 
Wonkette asks , â Is Gonzales somehow the smuggest asshole in this administration ?
Is that even possible ?â 
Actually , that âs a fair question .
With Rummy retired , who does hold that title ?
Who 's the smuggest asshole of all ?
