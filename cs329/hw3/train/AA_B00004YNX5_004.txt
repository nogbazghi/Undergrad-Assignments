This was a great hand mixer ( except for the fact that the lowest speed really is n't quite low enough - I dealt with that ) .
I had used one night to make a cake and frosting , without incident .
The next morning , when I went to make cookie dough - right after I turned it on , the right gear made a funny noise .
I used it single beater to finish the job ... but , knew that it was a throw-away device .
I was HUGELY disappointed .
I do have the warranty card ( I guess I never mailed it in !
LOL) , and it says it is covered for 3 years - but - I do n't have my receipt .
I know it is just about 3 yrs old now .
If you are able to purchase this mixer at a great price , as it is now on Amazon ( below thirty smackers ) and justify that it will only cost an average of ten bucks a year to use , it is a good deal .
I paid double that price .
Just do n't get too attached to it , it wo n't last as long as your other appliances , it realistically has a 3-4 yr shelf life .
I did use it several times a month .
I got my moneys ' worth , but , would certainly have expected it to last much longer than this .
I have a Black n Decker hand mixer that I bought when I was 17 on sale for ten smackers .
That one has had as much use and STILL WORKS FINE! !
My husband is happy because he now knows what I *need* for Mothers ' Day .
To me , a hand mixer is a NECESSITY for EVERY KITCHEN.
I , personally , would have liked something more frivilous .
;-)
P.S.
I do own a fabulous Kitchen Aid stand mixer , which is now 18 yrs old and going great .
My mothers Kitchen Aid is over 35 yrs old .
I use the hand mixer for convenience , because I do n't leave the stand mixer out on my counter .
