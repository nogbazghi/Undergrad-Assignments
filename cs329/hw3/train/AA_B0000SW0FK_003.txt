Great product ,but it 's been discontinued by B&D for about two years .My second one started going only into it 's 10th month .
So they have been sitting on the shelves and the batteries die so you do n't get the same charge .Hope you keep your receipt it has a 2 year warranty !
I highly recommend the new B&D 18 Volt cordless vacuum stick !
