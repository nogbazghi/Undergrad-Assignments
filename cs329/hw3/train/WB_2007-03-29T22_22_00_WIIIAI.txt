Astonishingly , Blair did not win over the Iranians with his devastating argument : 29 degrees 50.36 minutes north , 048 degrees 43.08 minutes east .
Both sides are taking umbrage at a fearsome rate , breaking it down into its constituent particles of outrage and processing it into great steaming piles of righteous indignation .
The Iranians had promised to release the chain-smoking sailor Faye Turney , but backtracked when Britain refused to admit it was in the wrong .
Then it released a letter written by Turney ( assuming her native tongue is Persian-badly- translated - into-stilted - English ) , admitting the incursion and calling on Britain to pull out of Iraq .
Blair said it was a âdisgrace actually , when people are used in that way .â 
He explained his tactics : â What you have to do when you are engaged with people like the Iranian regime , you have to keep explaining to them , very patiently , what it is necessary to do and at the same time make them fully aware there are further measures that will be taken if theyâre not prepared to be reasonable .â 
I donât know how they can fail to respond favorably to such an approach .
Interesting story in the Indy about how Turkey has restored a 1000-year-old Armenian Christian church abandoned during the Armenian genocide as a symbol of Turkeyâs new-found tolerance , but wonât allow it to have a cross or be re-consecrated .
Marijuana , like Viagra , is evidently not kosher for Passover ( which the pro-cannabis Green Leaf Party in Israel points out means that it must be kosher the rest of the year ) .
Probably just as well : the munchies and gefilte fish are not a good combination .
Speaking of not a good combination , George Bush spoke today .
About the war supplemental bill .
â[ W]e expect there to be no strings on our commanders ,â  he said .
Really , he should take that up with their tailors .
He also attended a ceremony at which Congressional Gold Medals were awarded to some of the Tuskegee Airmen .
For your captioning pleasure , some pictures of Bush with Nancy Pelosi and Robert Byrd .
