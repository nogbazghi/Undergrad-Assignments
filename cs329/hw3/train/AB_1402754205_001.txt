It was great to be able to come across this old classic again ; I guess most people of today have never heard of this book , which was one of a series , like the Bobbsey Twins ...my mom used to read this 5 Little Peppers book to me when I was little .
It is an excellent book for children because it gives them an idea of the way people lived a century ago .
Buy it !
Your young ones will like it !
