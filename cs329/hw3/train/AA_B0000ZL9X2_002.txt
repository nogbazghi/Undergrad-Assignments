These bowls are a great alternative to the heavy-weight glass bowls that came with my Sunbeam mixer .
This gal enjoys these lightweight yet durable , alternative high-quality , stainless-steel mixer bowls .
If you get bursitis but still like to cook , relief is here .
Consider these , they are the best quality , 18/10 .
