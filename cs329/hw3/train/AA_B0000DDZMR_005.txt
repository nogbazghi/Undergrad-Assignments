I bought a 12 cup , two 8 cup , and 4 two cup Anchor Hocking glass storage containers .
They would be terrific if the lids/containers were level .
Instead , the lids teeter-totter on top of the containers , on some as much as 1/4" .
Some are better than others , but none of them fit right .
I will not purchase another Anchor Hocking product that is made in China ( like these were ) and/or without being able to examine them in person first .
