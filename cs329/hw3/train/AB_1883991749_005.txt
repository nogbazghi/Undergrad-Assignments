Cohn and Merkel weave practical advice with absorbing and sometimes humorous tales of their stepparenting journey .
This book is more than a how-to ; it reads like a well-written family drama .
I finished it wondering what would happen next with this family and hoping for a sequel .
It also occurred to me that " One Family , Two Family " is likely to appeal to all families - not just stepfamilies -- since much of the insight provided by Merkel , a family psychologist , has universal application when it comes to human relationships .
This is a great read for anyone raising a family .
