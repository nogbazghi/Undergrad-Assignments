And I do n't expect him to .
-- he is forty seven and he has no clue .
He thinks I eat bon bons all day .
My husband 's twenty seven and he still does n't know , well , he does n't know yet though .
They -- they never know .
You know .
And -- and that 's , I guess , okay because they have to focus on --
Mhm .
-- different things , you know , than -- than we do , but --
Yeah .
And that 's fine .
Yeah .
That 's good .
I just --
But --
-- he wants to have more kids and I 'm -- I 'm to a point where my -- all my kids are old enough now where I do n't have to take care of them like , you know , they 're not infants anymore --
Right .
-- and so it 's -- it 's easier to take them to the babysitter for a day while I get something done .
Right .

You know I went to -- I took some nursing classes and at this point in my life , physically , it was very hard lifting the patients and it was -- it was really kind of too hard for me --
Mhm .
-- and , you know , I just -- I do n't think that at this point in my life it 's a time to begin that .
Okay .
You know .
Yeah .
Ah , I have some friends that are nurses and , you know , they 've already passed that , they 've already --
Mhm .
-- passed when -- when they were young and they got their nursing degrees and they did that , you 're younger and stronger --
Mhm .
-- and you get a little bit older and it 's -- it 's not as easy , you know , physically .
Even though we 're not old and ancient , you do n't have the same stamina and strength .
Mhm .
So -- and I know I lifted a patient and twisted -- he was a big guy and --
