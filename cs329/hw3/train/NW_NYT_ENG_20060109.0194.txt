everything else .
She takes 52 pills a day .
She has
everything in the book .
When she calls , she wants to
talk for 99 hours .
I say : ' My sister 's calling .
I 've
got to get off . " '
Matos said : " What , 52 pills ?
She 's nuts . "
Frank Gonzalez had something to say .
He was 77 , compact , peppy .
He used to work as a security guard at a
hospital , had clocked 16 years with diabetes .
When things were not going well , as they were n't now , you
could see the fanned-up embers in his eyes .
Hear his
speedy voice : " Diabetes is the worst disease I 've ever seen .
You ca n't trust it .
Two weeks ago , I got all
messed up .
You know why ?
I 've got two machines .
One
gave me a reading of 150 .
The other machine gave
me 130 .
I said this ca n't be .
So I changed
the batteries on both machines .
You 've got to keep an
eye on your machines . "
He went on .
" Diabetes is something you have to look at
from all sorts of angles .
It takes a long time
to find out the real truth .
And you know what ?
You never find out the real truth . "
He went home , a couple of blocks away , to take a
blood-sugar reading .
He opened a hallway closet , wedged full of
supplies -- test strips and lancets and pill bottles and
batteries .
Most , but not all for diabetes .
He showed a
bottle : Viagra .
Opened it and smiled : half-full .
He inserted a strip into his machine .
He swabbed his ring
finger with alcohol , then pricked it with a lancet .
The
machine counted down 45 seconds .
The reading : 152 .
High .
He
stared balefully at the number .
" It could be I 've been sitting too much , " he said .
" I
should be out and walking .
I do n't know , I was
going to do the cleaning . "
A GEOGRAPHY LESSON
A few things to notice .
On Third Avenue , around the corner
from the art shop , a banner outside McDonald 's proclaimed , " $ 1
Menu . "
Down the way , plastered on Burger King , " New Enormous
Omelet Sandwich .
It 's Huge . "
At KFC , a sign boasted , " Feed
Your Family for Under $ 4 each . "
The art-shop gatherers sometimes talked about 96th Street , the tangible southern
divide of a neighborhood and of a disease .
Go north
of 96th Street and you enter a constricted world laden
with poverty .
Go south and you find promise and riches ,
thin not fat , the difference between East Harlem and the
Upper East Side , the difference between illness and health .
Go north and the chances of bumping into a diabetic are
maybe 20 times greater than if you go south .
For
the Upper East Side , according to the health department , has
the lowest prevalence in the city , about 1 percent .
In East Harlem , people sometimes have to choose between getting their
diabetes medication and eating .
They sometimes share their pills , cut
them in half and take half-dosages .
They improvise .
Everywhere blare
the signals that the best meal is the biggest meal .
Nutritious food exists , but it is n't easy to find .
