While the premise of this novel was certainly intriguing enough - four disparate individuals meet on a popular London rooftop on the night each has individually decided to kill him/herself - enjoying it hinges on connecting with the characters in some fashion , whether it 's emotionally or otherwise .
Their troubles vary , but it 's hard to be sympathetic for characters you genuinely do n't like .
Half the time , I felt like these characters had brought all this hardship on themselves ( well , not Maureen ) , and listening to their constant whining over their situations grew thin halfway through the book .
I liked the way the book was structured , with short sections dedicated to each character in that character 's 1st POV , which gave it a theatrical quality , like each sat on a stool on a stage and when it was their turn , the spotlight would come on him/her while they told their tale .
But enjoying a story 's structure and premise is n't enough to make it a keeper .
I needed to connect and care about the characters in some way to do that .
And I did n't .
