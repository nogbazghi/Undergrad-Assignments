Blue Ocean Strategy is not such much a marketing book as it is a book on strategy .
That said , every CMO should absolutely read this book before they launch their next new product or service .
Kim and Mauborgne make the case that if companies are to succeed in the future , they need to stop battling competitors and getting bloodied , causing red oceans .
Instead companies that will be tomorrow 's leading companies will create "blue oceans " of uncontested market space .
They draw examples from every day brands with which we are familiar , including Cirque du Soleil , Yellow Tail wine , and Southwest Airlines to name a few .
I sincerely enjoyed this book , and walked away with some great ideas as they relate to approaching new business opportunities .
I highly recommend this book , and I guarantee you that you will refer back to the book as a reference source in the future .
