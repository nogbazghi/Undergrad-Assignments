This is simply the best book I have read in a long time .
<p>Andro Linklater writes clearly and eloquently about the love affair between Pamela Kirrage and Donald Hill at the eve of World War II .
He brings to life the great excitement of their budding romance and the long , difficult years they spent apart , Pamela doing her part to support England 's war efforts at home and Donald languishing in a Japanese concentration camp .
<p>The atrocities that Donald experienced are described in a matter of fact manner that does not take away from the sheer horror of what he must have endured .
He was determined to document what happened in the camp at the risk of his own life and eventually coded his diary to ensure that it would not be discovered .
Through it all , his promise to return to Pamela gave him the will to survive .
<p>Years later after Donald 's death , Pamela resolved to know the contents of his diary so she could understand what had happened to him , what had happened to them .
I found the efforts to decode his diary just as fascinating as the turbulent relationship between Pamela and Donald .
<p>This is an intelligent and articulate account of two passionate people caught up in the throes of war and their struggle to regain their lives and relationship once reunited .
It is a romance , a war history , and a mystery all rolled into one .<p> I
am recommending it to everyone I know .
Read it !
