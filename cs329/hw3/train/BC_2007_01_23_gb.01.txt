I would have never thought that he would have gotten an Oscar nomination unless he starred as " Pinocchio" , the wooden boy .
Peter O` Toole .
Yes .
" Venus" .
He` s going to get it because he` s old .
But you know , Forest Whitaker for " The Last King of Scotland " has been the favorite in terms of getting the Golden Globe .
Everybody is saying , you know , if you see anything , see " The Last King of Scotland " .
He really seems to be the shoo-in for best actor , as does Helen Mirren for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth in " The Queen " .
Those two kind of have it locked up .
She was good in that , actually .
I ca n` t believe I saw that .
I saw that movie trapped in a plane .
But she was really good .
But Peter O` Toole , I mean , he` s never really gotten an Oscar .
They gave him an honorary Oscar , which he almost turned down .
Yes .
I mean , but he` s a really good actor .
How about if he fakes his death ?
Would that sway them at all ?
Because that` s usually when you get it .
That` s a sign ...
It would be a posthumous award .
That would be a totally different category .
But I mean , that` s when Hollywood gives you the awards .
If I were old and they gave me the award I`d be like , " Oh , geez , I` m right around the corner from death .
Everybody is ready for me to die . "
Exactly .
He` s not going to get it .
And the Oscars do n` t tend to just be benevolent in terms of , " Well , you`ve been around for a long time .
You`re been a good actor .
You`ve done a great job .
Here you go .
Here` s the gold statuette . "
They do n` t do that .
So I do n` t think he` s -- he` s not going to get a sympathy vote .
May I bring up John Wayne and a long list of others .
Scorsese .
He` s healthy .
Does he get one or not ?
Eight times , nothing .
Right ?
This is so difficult .
It is -- it seems like it should be his time .
Yes .
But then again , it seems like it should have been his time several times before .
I could n` t believe -- I could n` t believe he` s never won one .
It` s hard to imagine .
When they say Scorsese has n` t gotten an Oscar , you think , you`re crazy , you`re kidding .
He did get the Globe , so that` s very good .
That` s a good premonition .
I think it` s his year .
It` s got to be his year .
Biggest surprise to you ?
Biggest surprise .
Besides the fact that most people have never seen any of these movies .
You know , they`ve seen more this year than last year , I have to say .
A lot of people have seen " Dreamgirls " .
Yes .
They have seen " Babel" .
I think , again , you mentioned earlier people are surprised that " Dreamgirls " did n` t get a nod for best picture .
Also that Brad Pitt got shut out again .
" Babel " got lots of nominations in other categories .
Brad did not get one .
But to be honest after seeing that film , his role was smaller .
There was a debate whether he would be a supporting actor candidate or a best actor candidate .
