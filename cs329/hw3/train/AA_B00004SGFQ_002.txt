Like the title says , I 'm giving this product a one star rating because there 's nothing lower .
I bought this along with the KA mixer for myself for Christmas .
Like one reviewer stated , this thing fails horribly on three points :
The plunger has no seal , so the ground forcemeat just pushes back out instead of going down to the worm gear .
The worm gear does n't seal either , so the plunger lets air into the chamber and the worm gear pushes it into the casing , creating air pockets in your sausage .
The stuffer is too high above the worksurface .
I wound up putting mine in a kitchen chair beside the counter and using textbooks to raise it to the right level .
If you plan on making even moderate amounts of sausage , just do the smart thing and get a sausage stuffer .
There is a very sturdy , highly recommended 5# model on the web , just search for stuffers and look in the $ 80 price range .
There 's not one thing about this product that I can compliment , except maybe that it 's cheap enough that I do n't feel like I blew a lot of money on a piece of garbage .
