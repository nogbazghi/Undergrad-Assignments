You`re making it very personal .
Look , Rosie` s a low life .
No, I understand .
You have to understand : I know Rosie .
Not just from this little incident .
Of course .
.where they`ve done a retraction .
I know Rosie , and Rosie is a low life .
Why make it so personal ?
Because Rosie lied about me .
Now she` s withdrawn the lie .
When somebody lies about me - you do n` t do that perhaps .
But when somebody lies about me , I attack back .
But Rosie is a woman of not great intelligence .
Rosie is a woman who I know .
Rosie is ultimately going to be a loser .
She lost on her show .
She lost on - her Broadway show was a total failure , as you know .
Her magazine was one of the worst catastrophes ever in publishing .
Rosie will ultimately hurt " The View . "
The only reason " The View "` s being helped is because people like me - I mean , I make it good .
But ultimately , people do n` t like her , and they`re going to turn off to " The View . "
Now Donald , you told me that you`re not taking advantage of all this as a publicity stunt .
But with " The Apprentice " about to launch , I ca n` t imagine that you`re hating all the press that` s coming out of this .
I do n` t like the press .
I do n` t like having to waste my time fighting some low life like Rosie .
I do n` t really have to do that .
But what I do n` t like doing is I do n` t like seeing somebody lie .
I mean , here I am one of the most successful businessmen in the world , and I have her saying that I declared personal bankruptcy .
I mean , give me a break .
And it turned out that I did n`t , and ABC made Barbara Walters read that statement .
Are you at all concerned thought , with the language that you`re using and the things that you`re saying about Rosie , that people could see it as being really mean ?
Because it` s playing out in public , and it could backfire on you .
No.
No. Rosie is a very mean person .
And Rosie is a bully .
And the only way - I learned this in high school - the only way you beat a bully is to hit them right between the eyes .
You got to hit them hard , and hit them fast and hit them right between the eyes .
Rosie has disappeared from Earth .
Rosie did n` t show up this week .
All of a sudden , miraculously , she was on vacation .
You know why ?
Because she` s a bully , and bullies are the most frightened people .
Rosie thought - in my opinion - in my opinion , this was an unscheduled vacation .
That` s what it is .
But Rosie - all of a sudden she happened to take a vacation this week ?
Rosie` s a bully , and you hit a bully between the eyes .
But again - you know , in high school , it did n` t play out on television , and - and my concern or - or question for you is , Do you think at all that this could backfire ?
