This little steam cleaner is n't only a cute , Bug-looking appliance , but it really works !
It puts out a pile of steam , getting floors , stoves , showers and those areas on the toilet that never see daylight CLEAN and SANITIZED.
It kills mildew on shower curtains .
Eliminates the need for toxic chemicals while getting grout nicely cleaned .
The steam evaporates quickly , so it 's even safe to use on wooden floors .
Notice , however , that this steamer wo n't clean your house on it 's own .
It 's still going to take some effort .
But at least your time and energy is n't wasted , because things really do come nicely clean .
The only drawback with this cleaner is that the manual does n't come with user suggestions .
Experimentation is your only option .
Thank goodness it 's easy to use , and it makes housecleaning a tiny bit more fun .
