I knew I would n't use this much so I chose to buy a cheaper model .
The very first time I used it the unit overheated and the motor just quit .
I tried turning it off for awhile to see if letting it cool down would remedy the problem .
An hour later it would n't even turn on .
I pitched it in the trash !
I wish I had n't wasted my money ! ! !
Total disappointment ! !
