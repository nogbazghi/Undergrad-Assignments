Assuming you 're not being glib , WIIIAI , I 'm going to have to disagree that that autocracy of the classes & masses equals dictatorship of the proletariat .
By denoting " classes " as opposed to "working classes " or some similar formulation , the Legion was quite consciously aligning themselves with the business interests that were usually their biggest financial backers , precisely because of their usefulness as a "patriotic " strike-breaking force or goon squad .
Hardly dictatorship of the proletariat , however odious that might be in both theory and practice .
More like dictatorship of the bosses ' militia .
I can tell you from personal experience that the descendants of the NW Legionnaires became the NW neo-Nazi skins of the 1990s .
I 'm speaking quite literally here , having been personally told by one said neo-Nazi that " My granddaddy used to kill you people . "
On the East Coast , the biggest purveyors of anti-union violence in the early 20th century were professional " security " organizations such as the Pinkerton Detective Agency and the police .
Here in the NW , it was militias such as the American Legion .
This history , I 'm sure , is not lost on right-wing politicians such as Dick Cheney as they watch support for their policies erode into historically low numbers .
It should not be lost on those of us of the left either as Cheney and his cohorts go about assiduously drumming up support among groups with historically documented brown-shirt tendencies .
