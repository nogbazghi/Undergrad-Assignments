And they , um -- and I talked to some random girl in Irving and she -- and we had to talk about how nine eleven affected us .
So , I think we -- all these little survey things have to do --
Oh , really ?
-- with like , terrorism and crap like that .
Oh , okay .
And nine eleven and , uh , the plight of it , and --
Oh , all right .
-- how it affects us .
So , that 's what ...
Oh , [inaudible ] I was talking to my sister , she said something about like , they -- they ask you about nine eleven , and they 'll ask you about like , your opinion on like , uh , TV , uh , reality TV shows and stuff .
Oh , I have n't gotten any of that yet .
Oh , you have n't gotten that , oh .
I mean , I do other surveys --
Uh-huh .
-- like , not for this , but I usually do other random surveys online and stuff --
Uh-huh .
-- that I get money for .
Oh .
It 's for all sorts of crap , but --
Oh , really ?
-- for this one mainly that 's what I 'm thinking that 's all it is .
They 're getting our opinions --
Oh .
-- on crap .
Yeah , I guess so .
Who told you about it ?
Your sister ?
Uh , actually my friend from Austin .
[inaudible] .
Oh , yeah , mine too .
Oh , really ?
Yeah .
I used to live there .
Oh , really ?
That 's cool .
Um , yeah .
Then I graduated .
So , now I 'm back here in Dallas .
Oh , I see .
On Six Seventy Five .
That 's cool .
But , you know ...
Like , have you made any -- have you made any -- any referrals yet or anything ?
For what ?
For this .
Oh , yeah .
Uh , I made one .
Oh , really ?
So , that 's a whole dollar for me .
Yeah , one dollar .
My friend got like , sixty bucks the other day .
Damn !
Yeah .
' Cause he like , he ...
I thought we were only allowed to do three of these , um , calling things .
Oh , I mean like , no .
Yeah , you get -- uh , but like , if you refer up to twenty people --
Oh , that 's right .
-- and you -- you get like , twenty dollars plus an additional five dollars 'cause every ten people you get you get a bonus of five dollars .
That 's nice .
So you get a additional thirty dollars , plus the thirty for the phone calls .
So , yeah --
Wow !
-- I 'm trying to get as many people --
I bet they 're gonna listen to ours and be like , these guys are n't talking about --
I know .
-- the subject .
I guess so .
So , that blows ...
I do n't know .
I -- like , um , I guess after this war thing , I do n't know if it 's gonna , uh , gonna lessen --
