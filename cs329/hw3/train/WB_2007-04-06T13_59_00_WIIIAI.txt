Headline of the day , from the BBC : âLost Frenchmen Ate Jungle Spiders .â 
The latest email from the McCain McCampaign informs us of these âfun facts â  about the Maverick : he is an avid fisherman , he likes chocolate ice cream and pizza with pepperoni and onions .
Hold the anchovies and jungle spiders ( which , by the way , the BBC informs us are âhairy .â )
It also quotes him on the âearly progress in Iraqâ  ( he means early in the âsurge , â  not stuff that happened in 2003 ) : âYou read every day about suicide bombings , kidnappings , rocket attacks and other terrible acts .
What we donât read about and what is new is a lot of the good news - the drop in the murders in Baghdad etc etcâ .
Thatâs not really good news so much as bad news , but somewhat less of it .
