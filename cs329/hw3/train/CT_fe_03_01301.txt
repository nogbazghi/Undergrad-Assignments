Yeah .
And , you know , is that a hobby or is that a job ?
For me , I guess it 's both .
Yeah .
Um --
I -- I consider it a hobby because it 's something fun .
To me it 's something fun to do .
Oh , yeah , it is fun .
Yeah .
And it 's a lot of fun .
What kind of places do you do shops at ?
Every place .
Restaurants , retail , um , I had my carpets cleaned last week .
Oh , that 's nice .
Yeah .
Um , gas stations , movie rentals .
I try to do things where -- you know , I do grocery stores --
Mhm .
-- so , you know , I 'm going there anyway .
Right .
I need groceries anyway .
You know , gas , hey , I 'll -- I 'll get reimbursed for gas happily .
Right .
I think that 's the key .
As long as it 's something that you would normally do and not just a special case , for the most part .
Right .
Yeah , I have started doing , um , some resort shops .
Oh , yeah ?
And we went to Gatlinburg and we went to [inaudible ] and we 're going to Disney , um , so that 's -- that 's been a lot of fun .
That 's really neat .
That 's -- I mean , that 's awesome .
You know , you ca n't take three vacations inside of a year like that --
Oh , yeah .
-- when you have to pay for everything yourself .
You just c - -- I mean , nobody can do that .
Yeah .
Well , maybe somebody can , but I ca n't .
Yeah .
But , yeah , I guess that is really my -- my hobby .
Um --
Yeah , that 's --
-- I was a little reluctant to mention mystery shopping 'cause it 's so hush hush .
Yeah .
But I 'm glad you did .
Where are you from ?
I am about an hour outside of Chicago .
Brrr .
So , it 's -- yeah , it gets cold --
-- but it actually warmed up this week .
Yeah .
Got outside and cranked up the grill Sunday night for dinner , so ...
That 's nice .
See , that 's -- I guess that could be a hobby , grilling .
Yeah , that 's my husband 's hobby , grilling .
He got his new grill on Friday .
We had one that broke and then he got the new one Friday and we had it going by Sunday , so he 's all excited about that .
Well , good .
Do you ever , um , get on volition dot com ?
No, I have n't .
You should go there .
That 's -- that 's the mystery shopping place .
It 's volition , V.O.L.I.T.I.O.N.
Uh-huh .
Dot com .
Uh-huh .
And there 's a chat room and we go in there every night .
So , that 's another hobby , I guess .
Yeah .
Um --
