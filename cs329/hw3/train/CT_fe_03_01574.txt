Yeah .
Uh , not -- not , you know , very much at all .
Okay .
Uh , I have no real reason to and I have n't gone anywhere on vacation , uh , you know --
Okay .
-- that would require me to fly .
Right , I see .
Basically driving .
Yeah .
That 's basically the --
Um , but I think that the airways , um ... I -- I think that they 're -- you know , they 've always been relatively safe .
Ba - -- uh , well , uh , uh , statistically speaking they say that 's one of the safest modes of traveling .
Well , exactly .
As far as , uh , uh , uh , uh , um , you know , um , fatal accidents .
When you consider , you know , trains and you consider , uh , cars --
Mm .
-- things like that .
It 's just that usually when you have one the loss is greater because of the amount of people on there .
Exactly .
That 's what , you know .
But , uh , yeah , I 'm not really much on air travel .
I like the rail system better .
I love the trains , yeah .
Oh , no , I -- that -- that rail system scares me .
Really ?
Oh , man , I -- I love the train .
Just to be able to walk back and forth , be able to look out the window , watch the countryside .
Mm .
And I traveled back and forth to North Carolina during my college years and I fell in love with the rail .
Yeah .
You know , I went to , uh , uh , Fisk , for a very short time .
Okay .
I went as a visiting student for a year .
Is that Tennessee somewhere ?
Hm ?
Tennessee is it ?
Yeah , Tennessee .
National Tennessee .
Yeah , yeah .
Okay .
And I flew then and , uh , yeah , I -- I just like the , you know -- the -- the speed w- with which you 're able to get from point A. to point B.
Okay .
Yeah .
Most people do , right ?
And I always felt relatively safe .
I mean , my thinking is that , you know , if something is really gonna happen there 's not a whole lot you can do to stop it .
That -- well , that -- that 's true .
That 's true .
You know , I mean , some things are predestined to happen , uh , you know , we all have an appointed time to check out .
Okay .
Okay .
And , uh , you know , when it 's time to check out you will check out .
Yeah .
You know , whether you want to or not .
That 's true .
Whether you 're ready or not .
That 's right .
You know what I mean ?
Regardless of what precautions you took --
Yeah .
-- you know , you will check out when it 's time to check out .
Well , I just think o - o - of who , uh , take the necessary precautions you could somehow lessen your chance of it .
