I ca n't say enough good things about this book .
I had tried everything .
I was fairly successful on the Body for Life program , but it took too much time .
All I did on that program was eat and workout .
I have a life .
I need time for my family , work , continuing education and other activities .
When I saw my life suffering at the expense of my body , I had to compromise the Body for Life program .
I then ballooned back up to being obese .
My doctor tried to talk me into a gastric bypass because my weight was getting so bad .
This book from the Mayo Clinic gave me a diet that was very easy and had a lot of great food .
I have n't even been tempted to wander from this program at all .
The variety of food has filled my food addiction while also taking the weight off of me .
I have been continually losing weight and my doctor is not worried about me at all now .
She even just filled out a physical report stating that I am in very good health .
If you want good food , good health and time for a real life , this is the only book for you .
