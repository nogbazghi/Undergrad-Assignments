I bought this at Walgreens a year ago .
I wish I had n't .
The humidifier seems OK at first with the mentol because you can easily detect menthol .
But really this is n't doing much at all .
It does n't push moisture in the air whatsoever when my Sunbeam did .
The difference was that you can feel the water on the Sunbeam , and on the Halls version you could n't .
This means that all your getting is a menthol treatment that you could easily get from a cough drop or two .
Not recommended unless you just have a cough , not a cold .
