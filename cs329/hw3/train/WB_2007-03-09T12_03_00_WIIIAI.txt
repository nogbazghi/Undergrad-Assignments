You know how Cheney , Rice , Rumsfeld etc are always making âsurpriseâ  trips to Baghdad ?
Today someone visited Baghdad and it was a genuine surprise : Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki actually took a trip outside the Green Zone , unannounced and during the Friday ban on vehicle movement and not , of course , to a Sunni neighborhood , but still it was pretty darned brave of him .
Bush is in Brazil , meeting with President Lula , who would nât shut up about biofuel , although from the pictures Iâve seen , Brazil is powered entirely by the burning of American flags and kind of lame effigies .
Bush agrees with Lula that alternative fuels are important : â In other words , dependency upon energy from somewhere else means that you âre dependent upon the decisions from somewhere else .â 
And , as a former Texas oil-man , he knows where gasoline comes from : âAnd so as we diversify away from the use of gasoline by using ethanol weâre really diversifying away from oil .â 
And itâs all about the incumbentosity : âwe all feel incumbent to be good stewards of the environment .â 
In the last paragraph I quoted one of Bushâs famous âin other wordsââs .
Hereâs another ( he was speaking at a Petrobras plant ) : âOne of the things I like , as the President noted , is that a good ethanol policy and good alternative fuel policy actually leads to more jobs , not less .
In other words , at this plant there are jobs .â 
He uttered another sentence that does not need other words , because it is perfect just the way it is : â I appreciate so very much the fact that much of your energy is driven by sugarcane .â 
Itâs not just the fuel , but the vehicles the fuel goes into : â Well , most people in America donât know that there are millions of flex-fuel vehicles on our street today .
Just people donât know it .â 
Iâm pretty sure I got stuck on that street once .
Itâs in LA , right ?
The last time he was there , Bush memorably exclaimed â Wow , Brazil is big .â 
Today he said , âYou know , Brazil and the United States are the two largest democracies in our hemisphereâ .
Somewhere , a Canadian is thinking of writing a mildly cross letter pointing out the fallaciousness of that statement but , being Canadian , will no doubt decide to âletâs not get excited , eh .â 
If I declare a caption contest for this picture (original caption here ) , how much am I going to regret it ?
