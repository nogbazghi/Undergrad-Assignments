Mhm .
-- I guess , like , thinking about that , I really do n't think that I would take the money because , I mean , I 'm also not really that much of a superficial person , you know ?
Like , I do n't need a million dollars .
I 'm happy ... you know , I 'm content with , you know , what I have , especially , you know , I just -- I really learned the value of a friendship , you know ?
If you have a million dollars and you do n't have the companionship that you need , then it really does n't matter .
Yeah .
I think to be ... yeah , I think you 're right on being alone and having money .
Right .
Exactly .
You know , money could probably buy you friends but what do they really ... what are they really there for ?
They would n't really be your friends .
Exactly .
Yeah .
Exactly .
I do n't know .
It 's hard .
I 've actually -- I 've heard that about um ... I saw something on TV about , um , famous people and how they have entourages and how they pay for all their friends to , um , you know , like , go out for dinner and stuff and the reason that they do that is because they say , like , there 's no point in having wealth if you ca n't share it with people , you know .
Mm .
There 's no point in having all the money if you do n't have anyone to share it with .
Yeah .
I wonder if -- if that 's it ?
Like , if they ... or if they 're just ... they -- because of the lifestyle that they lead , they -- it has a really hard ... I 've heard a lot of celebrities say it 's really hard to figure out who your true friends are because when the money comes rolling in ... like Oprah and --
Right .
-- like , really wealthy people say , you know , it 's hard to figure out who your friends are .
Usually , it 's the one that was there before they mone[ ? ]
came rolling in because once the money 's there , you never know what the true motives of somebody hanging round you is .
Right .
Yeah .
And certainly -- and -- I mean , a million dollars would n't come close to putting you on that stature , I mean ...
Mhm .
... a million dollars today is not --
It 's really not that much .
-- not ... right .
I mean , not like I 'd turn it down if somebody wanted to give it to me for free .
But ... you know , I mean ...
It 's true , it 's true .
It could --
M- most people that get money that quickly like , say , people that win the lottery , end up just spending it ridiculously , you know and today , you never know .
You can invest it in the stock market and have nothing .
Right .
You know ?
You 'll end up without the money and the best friend .
