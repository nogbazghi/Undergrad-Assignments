-- it 's the biggest Texas city and --
I have a friend that has a cabin in Cuchara , Colorado and I used to go out there quite a bit .
Yeah .
A lot of people have those neat little cabins and [inaudible ] it 's a lot of pretty things .
Yeah .
That makes it -- makes it fun to be able to visit when -- when we come down there to vacation sometimes because my brother lives , um , near Dallas , so we come down there , so we kind of trade back and forth , I guess .
I see .
You probably pass this way .
Pardon ?
You probably pass this way quite a few times now .
Could be , could be .
Mhm .
Yeah .
[inaudible ] pretty close to Amarillo , so --
Mhm .
That 's true , it 's not that --
-- you know this part of the country , then .
Well , yeah , and I would have , you know , pretty -- it 's not unlike our 's really , not that different , kind of flat , kind of windy .
Kind of dry right now .
Oh , man , it 's real dry here .
Yeah , we 're -- we 're --
We could sure use some rain .
We 're expecting a pretty -- [several inaudible words ] getting ready to get some , um , I mean it looked like , ah , this -- a pretty big system , they , ah , you may be in a couple of days .
Yeah , we did have some rain , ah , ah possibility for rain forecast for tomorrow and the next day .
Yeah .
Yeah .
Right now it 's really nice out , but , um , this is supposed to be a pretty big one and the real big low , big slow moving storm and we might get as much as eight inches of snow by Wednesday , so ... But that 's spring for you , that happens sometimes --
-- late spring -- late spring blizzards .
Yeah .
They sure blow up .
Do you get a lot of snow there ?
Uh , we have -- we 've been in -- in drought conditions for quite a while and , you know , it 's , ah , I do n't think we 've gotten more than a few inches over the winter for the last couple of winters --
I see .
-- and -- so , it would be nice to get , you know , we could sure use some .
Yeah , we have n't even had much snow lately .
This year , anyway .
Yeah .
It 's been a pretty warm winter on the whole .
So , we 're -- we 're hoping to get -- because it 's -- [inaudible ] bad they 're doing some , you know , real -- real severe water restrictions up in -- up [inaudible] , you know , the big towns , Denver and -- and what not , ah , because they just do n't have -- they just do n't have it in the reservoirs .
I see .
And , ah , you know , so they 're really -- they 're talking about closing down the car washes and , um , you know , no new lawns and you can only water your lawn once a week and , you know , there 's , ah --
