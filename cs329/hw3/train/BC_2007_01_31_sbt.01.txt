But very quickly , Tom - you know , we`re seeing these pictures now .
But you can bet somebody` s going to slip into that theater with a camera phone .
He is nude in the play .
This could get worse .
O`NEI
This could get really worse .
That` s the biggest danger here is .
They`re not going to be able to block out all of the camera phones .
They`re certainly going to try to collect them at the door .
All this has to do is one of these pictures go on the Internet , which you - is probably inevitable , and at 17 years old - wow , imagine the outcry that going` s to surround this next .
Despite the controversy , the show will go on .
Scheduled to start next month .
Tom O`Neil from " In Touch Weekly , " thanks as always .
O`NEI
Thanks , Brooke .

Women over 40 , gather around .
OK .

LOIS JOY JOHNSON , " MORE" MAGAZIN
It` s an appealing way to look at products .
And we do n` t want to see women who are in their teens or 20s selling wrinkle creams or wearing expensive clothes .
In a way , that` s insulting .
Hollywood has been working fast and furiously to make up for being late to the life-starts-at-40 party , with TV shows like " Desperate Housewives " .
Not if you`re sucking my exhaust you wo n`t .
.moves like Diane Keaton` s " Because I Said So " .
And actually , I am taking stock of my life .
.and now the ad market .
