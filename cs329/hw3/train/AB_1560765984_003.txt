When I pick out a module , my biggest gripe is that the majority of novels are n't well thought out and therefore have plot holes or illogical maneuvers .
<p> In order to get around this , I usually pay attention to the game designer credits to up my chances of getting a good piece .
But , that does n't always work so I like to be able to flip through the item .<p>DRAGON
MOUNTAIN is broken up in to three books with illustrious maps and score cards .
The first book lays out the overland adventure and certain parts do n't make sense and are probably there to beef the party up .<p>However , the module makes up for this shortcoming in that the second and third books are put together quite well .
This is a perfect example of where you can use very weak monsters , give them terrain and trap advantages with lots of magic and they can easily mess up party members .
It can also be humiliating to the PCs if that turns you on as a DM.
:D<p>The leader at the end of the story is tough and intelligent .
Creators actually took the time to explain her battle strategies rather than rely on the DM figuring it out .<p>The
fact that this mountain can shift from plane to plane makes it easy to fit in to any campaign .
If , for some reason , your PCs are higher level , put a tougher race in place of kobolds and beef up the leaders .<p>Overall , the idea of weak monsters being able to take on midlevel and high level adventurers is a keen concept .
Most DMs toss such creatures out when the PCs get to a certain level .
This boxed set rejuvenates a weak race like kobolds .
For that reason alone , I rank it five stars as great .<p>SOHP
