This book is fabulous !
It is a great story about being beautiful on the inside and respecting and loving yourself .
What a great self-confident heroine !
My daughter ( almost age 6 ) picked it up at the library along with other princess books and I enjoyed reading every page of this book .
It has justice in it and a very happy ending : " People would often say what a handsome couple she and Egbert made , but they found their true joy reading good books to each other by the fire every evening , sharing a good laugh , and simply enjoying the pleasure of each other 's company . "
THAT is a fairytale to emulate .
It was published in 2004 , and I am greatly surprised not to see it plastered with awards .
The illustrations are magnificent in and of themselves .
