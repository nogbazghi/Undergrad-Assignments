I purchased my Bemis Credenza Variable Speed Whole House Humidifier in January 1994 from Home Depot .
At the time it was model 6964 , but I believe this is the successor .
Have had this thing so long even the company changed hands ( now owned by Essick ) .
Anywho , I used this for about 8 Maryland winters to humidify a 2,000 sf house .
Then we moved and have used it to humidify just our bedroom ( about 400 sf ) for the past 6 years .
The wick usually lasts the whole season .
Then it 's cleaned out as directed at the end of the season , the fan blades are cleaned and the fan motor oiled , a cover is put on it to keep the dust out and it 's ready to go for the next year .
It has been fantastic !
The only negative about it is the noise .
When it was humidifying the whole house , it was not located near the bedrooms so when it started and stopped ( in accordance with the humidity register ) , the noise did n't disturb us .
However , now it is in the bedroom and I keep it on low fan speed continuously ( sort of like " white noise " ) and we turn it off in the morning .
Otherwise , I 'd be up all nite as it shut on and off .
Another slight issue is the cost of the wicks---as I was painfully reminded of it when I finally found one at Ace Hardware for $ 22 ( but then all of them seem priceythese days , do n't they ? ? ) .
Nonetheless , it is one of the best household health appliances I have ever owned .
