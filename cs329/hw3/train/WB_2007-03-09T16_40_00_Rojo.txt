" Well yes , Mr. President Bush , former Indian Prime Minister Morarji Desai did believe that drinking your own urine improved your health , but , I do n't know , yours smells kind of funny .
Less like urine and more like Uribe . "
P.S.
I 'm not making that shit up about Morarji Desai and the urine-drinking .
I met him once when he was PM at age 7 , got to shake his hand , and found out later that he drank his own pee .
I was one grossed out 7-year-old and took to OCD hand washing behavior for like a month .
P.P.S.
Since ethanol ( sugarcane ) and my childhood year in India seem to have come together , I hope you 'll forgive me for reminiscing a moment about the sugarcane juice stands in India back in 1977 .
They had stacks and stacks of raw fresh-cut sugar cane and a press .
You would pay them your five or ten paise ( 100 paise to a rupee--I got a four-rupee a week allowance , spoiled little brat that I was )and they run the sugar cane through the press , letting the juice pour into a little glass , which they would then hand to you .
Oh .
My .
God .
Sweeeeeet , sweeeeeeeeeet sugarcane juice !
So much better than candy .
There was a sugarcane juice stand two bus stops before my home on the way home from school and I risked parental wrath for that nectar every single time I had the requisite paise !
Anyone that lives in NYC can check out the same glories by heading out to the Bronx , where I noticed , upon last visit , that Jamaican street vendors have set up similar stands ( although I imagine the cane is not quite as fresh ) .
P.P.P.S. Yes , I know urine does n't come close to rhyming with Uribe , but was too taken with the recent scandal ( not that it 's a surprise ) linking Uribe to death squads that are engaged in trafficking a substance that Bush reportedly used to take to like , well , like a seven-year-old to sugarcane juice .
...And yes , I do realize that if a joke requires that much explanation , it 's not very funny
