-- so --
it sounded like an easy ten dollars .
Yeah , that 's what I thought too --
-- I 'm like , well , I need money right now , so I actually -- did you get the one about the soup ?
I got another --
No.
-- one that was like , if you agreed to be on a conference call talking about soups then we 'll pay you twenty dollars .
And I agreed to it , but I never got any more .
No, this was the first one I got .
I never got any more information , so I guess I missed that one .
Hm .
Yeah , I get this kinda stuff all the time and I 'm like , " Ah , I do n't know" .
Figured I 'd see if it actually worked out or not .
Mhm .
Well , now we have to see if we get the money .
Ex - exactly .
It seems pretty legit though .
Yeah .
I know , the only thing is I got the email like two or three weeks ago that said it would be coming within a couple of days and it 's just first coming now .
Yeah , that 's about when I got it too .
So , you know , I kind of forgot about it until I just came home and saw it on my caller ID.
I 'm like , " Oh" .
So , how long are we supposed to talk ?
Did it say ?
Ten minutes .
Ten minutes ?
Yeah .
Oh .
I 'm not sure what time it started .
I 'm not sure either .
It seems like a long ten minutes .
Where do you live ?
Um , Iowa .
Do you really ?
Yeah .
Oh I 'm -- I 'm -- I live in Wisconsin but I 'm moving back to Iowa this weekend .
Oh , wow .
Yeah , to the Buke[ ?] .
Hm .
I 'm in the Quad cities .
Oh , okay .
Yeah , I kind of know that area .
We used to go down there for shopping 'cause , you know , at the Buke there 's nothing .
I 've --
So .
-- never really been there .
We 've only lived here a few years .
Oh , really ?
I think I 've been their first talker .
Mhm .
There 's like -- there 's a couple of good miles on the Quad cities .
I know that or at least there used to be .
Yeah , not bad .
When we were in highschool we 'd all hang out down there .
My son would about die if he heard that people actually travelled to the Quad cities to do stuff .
Really ?
Why , where 's he from ?
Oh , we moved here from Maryland .
Oh , from Maryland , okay .
Just outside of DC .
Oh .
And he says that there 's nothing here .
Yeah , I 'm sure it probably seems that way .
We --
Yeah , if --
