This book and the music CD is a staple at our house .
My daughter has loved all the music since she was under 1 , and now she is 2 and still asks to listen to it .
My daughter started signing at 7 months and knew more than 25 signs at a year old .... and I owe it all to the Sing and Sign program .
It is fantastic !
You ca n't go wrong with this book ... especially since it also has a great music CD to listen to anytime .
