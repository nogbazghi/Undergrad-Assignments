We purchased a Hamilton Beach cool mist humidifier for our daughter .
We go through one filter/month .
The filters are not sold in any locals stores and we can only buy them on Amazon .
We usually have to purchase ( 6 ) at a time because the filters smell moldy after 3-4 weeks .
Now the price has jumped from $ 6.99/filter to $ 15/filter .
We are disappointed with the product and it 's permformance .
