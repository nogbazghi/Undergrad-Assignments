This book is the story of the devastating tsunami that hit the island of Hawai'i on April 1 , 1946 .
It includes factual information woven throughout the story of a man whose brother died that long ago day when they were both students at the school where the tsunami hit .
But it is much more than just an historical account .
This is the story of a boy 's love for his grandfather and a man 's faithful remembrance of his brother 's death in that tsunami .
It is , at the same time , both sad and hopeful .
This story speaks to children of all ages .
Before reading this book to my seventh grade class , we discussed the science of tsunami .
Information in the " Author 's Notes " at the end of the book was helpful in understanding the event .
After reading the book , the students were visibly moved .
They spoke of their relationships with their own grandparents and their feelings of loss when a loved one died .
The illustrations were beautifully colorful and expressive and they complemented the story .
This is a beautiful book and a beautiful story .
