This ice cream maker works just fine .
I was a bit hesitant to buy it because of the other reviews , but now I 'm glad I did .
I 've put in two cups of whole milk cherry vanilla jogurt with a little bit of cream and in 15-20 minutes I had a nice batch of frozen yogurt .
Just make sure to chill it really well .
I rate it 4 stars because of the high price .
