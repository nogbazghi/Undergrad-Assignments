Mhm .
I mean , thinking about uh , you know , how you can live the rest of the life .
I mean ...
That 's true .
... how old are you ?
How old are you now ?
That 's true .
To have that financial security and it could mean --
Yeah .
Financial security --
-- yeah , it could mean more than just uh one friend would to you , you know ?
Mhm .
That 's true , you know .
You can have other friends .
Yeah .
That 's true .
And of course like when you automatically get the money , people au - automatically come to you , I mean , th - that 's the kind of background which I 've come from , like , you know ?
Mhm .
Whenever you have the money , you always get people around you and they can always [several inaudible words ] ...
That 's true .
Mhm .
... I mean , you -- you just call a person for a vacation and , you know , you both can get closer and then like , you know , become very good friends even if you lose one friend , like , you know ?
You can always go for one more .
That 's true , that 's true .
how old are you now ?

See if you get a million dollars you not think about working any more .
You can retire --

Maybe more important than a friend would be .
Yeah and financial security .
That -- that 's the keyhole there , I mean , you know ?
Mhm , mhm , yes .
pro- probably if you are given a chance for that , you want to have a million dollars or do you want to leave your family , then probably taking the family would be better than taking the million dollars .
Mhm , yeah .
But probably a friend wo n't be that important , I believe ?
Yeah , that 's true , yeah .
I uh your family would be a little different situation there .
You would definitely want to choose your family .
