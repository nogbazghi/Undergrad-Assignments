This Hoover Floormate gets the job done , however if you have a larger hardwood/tile floor surface I would suggest spending more on the floormate with rotating brushes .
Mine is over two years old and still works great but do plan on upgrading soon .
No problems at all with it .
Just need to change the filter every few months .
