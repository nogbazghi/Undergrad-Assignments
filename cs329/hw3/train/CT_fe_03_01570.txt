-- we 've going to pay a whole lot to do something like that .
So ...
Well , no doubt .
I mean , I -- I -- I ca n't see , you know ... I -- I can understand them wanting to , you know , provide for their family but , I mean , provide for their family on less than a hundred thousand dollars a year .
I mean , depending on w- --
No kidding !
-- where you live .
Yeah .
I mean ...
Well , and CEOs , I mean , there 's a lot of CEOs who are , you know , head of major corporations that are making in the three , four -- I guess some of them may even be making five hundred thousand a year .
A- it seems like anybody making half a million or thereabouts is more than well endowed for whatever they need and if they need more than that then you 're spending it on the wrong things .
So ...
Yeah .
Well , if they 're gonna make fourteen million dollars they can only play for one year .
Yeah .
There you go !
I like that idea .
You 're only allowed to play for one year if your -- uh , your salary is over a million dollars you can play for one year !
Yeah .
But where would Michael Jordan be ?
Yeah .
No one would want to play sports then though .
Yeah .
Yeah .
That -- that would be true .
Yeah .
It seems like most of them play I 'm thinking maybe ten , fifteen years would n't you say ?
I do n't remember .
Um , if we 're just talking professionally , if they go --
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
-- right out of college , probably , yeah , because they 're getting out of college , you know , at like twenty two if they go for four years and --
Mhm .
-- you know , they 're playing for like --
It seems most of 'em by the time they 're thirty five are kinda done , and rarely do you find a professional athlete in their forties .
Although they did a little cameo on one the other day on -- I think it was TV someplace , about , uh , um , some baseball player that was forty two and he was still doing really well , and I was , like , " Oh , okay ! " Huh .
Yeah .
I do n't know .
I 'm -- I do n't really -- I hear a sports guy and I just change the channel , you know ?
Yeah .
I -- I do n't -- not into sports at all .
I mean --
We are n't either .
I was very fortunate and married a --
It -- it --
-- a nice man who 's not either .
Yeah .
We -- I think we -- all we watch --
So ...
-- is the superbowl every year .
My -- it 's -- it 's funny 'cause my sister she 's , um , almost seventeen --
