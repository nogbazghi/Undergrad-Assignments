This reads like Tom Wolfe knew all the sleazebags in Hollywood and had to answer to an editor .
" Bonfire of the Vanities " , " Man in Full " and " I Am Charlotte Simmons " smart .
It 's that good .
Exceedingly clever , well-observed and continuously hilarious while mixing in sequences of pathos , depravity and madness .
If you 're looking for a crime thriller this is not it .
Fans of the Shane Scully series who gave this book a bad review testify to this fact .
But if you are looking for something that skewers the shallowness of current society and the people who inhabit it , you may find this book as focused , concise and brilliant as I do .
Bravo Stephen J. Cannell .
