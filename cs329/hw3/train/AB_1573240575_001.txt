The author did not do all her homework .
There are serious factual inaccuracies that will leap out at anyone who knows anything about the history of women in medicine , the history of medical education , or the history of medicine in the United States .
A far better book , aimed at the same young audience , is " Elizabeth Blackwell : Physician and Health Educator " by Deborah Kent ( ISBN 1592960022 ) .
For older readers , Elizabeth Blackwell 's life is best covered by Julia Boyd 's " The Excellent Doctor Blackwell : The Life of the First Female Physician " ( ISBN 0750941405 ) .
