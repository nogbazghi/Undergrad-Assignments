Oh yes .
And we did n` t have many breakout hits this fall season , and this was a huge hit .
Do you like the show ?
It` s so great .
I love the show .
O`NEI
I do , too .
And a great meaning behind it , and America said that backstage .
You know , she` s so glad that it` s not only entertaining , but also tells people that , Hey , it does n` t have to be this skewed perception of each other , you know ?
O`NEI
Here` s how big the win was on the series side - here` s how to predict the Golden Globe series awards , all of those awards : always go for the hot , new , young stars in the acting slots .
But in the categories for picture - for drama series and comedy series , it` s usually one year behind .
Last year , " Lost " and " Desperate Housewives " won - a year late .
Theoretically , " The Office " should have won this year .
You see how I` m going ?
And then ...
O`NEI
And then ...
... "Ugly Betty " maybe next year .
O`NEI
Yes .
So they`re ahead of the curve this year , then .
O`NEI
They love this show so much , they gave it both awards .
What about Hugh Laurie from " House " ?
Not only beat McDreamy ( ph ) from " Grey` s Anatomy , " Patrick Dempsey , but also Kiefer Sutherland from " 24 ."
O`NEI
I know .
I know .
A recent Emmy award who is hugely popular .
O`NEI
He` s huge .
But this is the Hollywood Foreign Press Association ....
Right .
O`NEI
...and I think , quite frankly , he charmed them so much with that British accent and that hilarious acceptance speech , and he did it again tonight .
He was brilliant at the podium .
Well " Grey` s Anatomy " did get a lot of recognition , though .
Because they won Best Series Drama .
Beat " Heroes , " beat " Lost , " " 24 ."
Also big ...
O`NEI
One year late .
So you see how the pattern goes ?
It really - it was the hot new show of last year , and it wins here .
It` s kind of interesting how the pattern works .
So the Hollywood Foreign Press really getting on the ball with - with these talent this year .
O`NEI
Yes , but the thing - what - the outstanding thing about the whole lineup this year , Brooke , was that they snubbed most of the hot new TV shows .
Normally , when you look through the list of nominees , it` s all the hot new shoes .
They hate - they - they nominated only three or four .
So they had to give it to the veterans , like " Grey` s Anatomy " and " House . "
Well , let` s talk about some one who is new on this scene , and back bigger and better than ever : Alec Baldwin .
O`NEI
Yes .
You know , he beat Steve Carell , Jason Lee , Tony Shalhoub , Zack Braff .
You know , we know him as the movie star .
But do you think this really validates his versatility and talent that he can do this on the small screen , too ?
O`NEI
I know .
I know .
He - he` s so brilliant in that show , and they love movie stars here .
So the combination and his comeback , it` s - it` s - it` s perfect Globe fare .
