On the presumably solemn occasion of the beginning of the 5th year of the war in Iraq , Bush scheduled a visit , not to Walter Reed , not to a military base , but with a college football team , the Florida Gators , in which he told jokes and generally yucked it up .
And he got a t-shirt and a football .
Heâd show up at the amputee wing of Brooke Army Medical Center more often if they gave him a t-shirt and a football .
He called the Gators âa well-coached team .â 
Compare and contrast with the US military .
And indeed , compare and contrast his speech earlier in the day â  âIâm grateful to our servicemen and women ... Iâm grateful to our military families for all the sacrifices they have made for our country â  â  with the photo op with the Gators : âAnd so I congratulate not only the players , but I congratulate the coaching staff .
I congratulate all those who pick up the towels and make the program run .â 
