This attachment is EXCELLENT and doing organic appleasauce couldnt be easier .
It 's easy to put together and the results are amazing .
I core my apples , and from what I 've been told , that 's not even necessary although I still do it out of habit .
Then boil them for a few minutes and drop them into the feed and out comes perfect applesauce .
I did well over 20 quarts this year and my kids gobble it up , all organic and sugar free .
They REQUEST it for snack !
Thanks KitchenAid !
By the way , this is Brians wife ...lol !
