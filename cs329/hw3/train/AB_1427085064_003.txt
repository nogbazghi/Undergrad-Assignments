I got this book with cd a couple weeks ago and I absolutely love it !
I listen to the cd at night before turning in and in the morning before I get up .
I have noticed that I make better food choices and I dont get down on myself any more .
To tell the truth , I would n't be without it !
I have n't weighed or measured myself as of yet , and may not do so , but give it time to be a lifestyle change !
