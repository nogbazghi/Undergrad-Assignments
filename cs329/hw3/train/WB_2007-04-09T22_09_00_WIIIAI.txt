Yes , however you interpret it , it 's a badly constructed sentence , but my interpretation fits a line of argument he 's often used before .
" Comprehensive immigration reform " means increased border enforcement plus a temporary worker program plus some sort of amnesty .
He uses the word comprehensive to fight ( but not very hard ) Republicans ' desire just to build a wall and hire more border patrollers and leave the rest out .
I do n't think either of those products have enough dairy content even to be able to legally call themselves "processed cheese food products , " much less cheese .
Cheez , however , is evidently okay .
