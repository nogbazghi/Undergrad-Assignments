Whatever you do , dear reader , do not read this book straight through .
Attempting this will introduce you quite early in your reading to the logical fallacy known as the Binary Nature of All Assertions , which ( mis )states that anything & everything is either true or false .
The first puzzle resides in an ambiguous state , which , per se , is fine by me .
Too bad the authoring logicians disagree , arbitrarily choosing one of these states from the ether for their so-called solution .
I give this book 5 stars not in spite but , rather , because of this failing .
For not all books carry their utility in their logic .
This book would make a wonderful practical joke gift to a friend or , perhaps , an enemy .
But never claim to have solved every puzzle in the book , for someone might realize on puzzle 1A , if they have a brain , that you do n't have a brain .
Another use would be to give this book out to the youth of a generation & make them despise this thing they do n't get called logic , tempting them into the soft arms of faith , & saving them into the kingdom of heaven where reigns a god whom none have seen but all believe .
In short , having mastered the logic of this book , I give it a 5 !
