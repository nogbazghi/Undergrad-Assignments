The theory behind this refill is that there is one perforated filter per box that can be broken in half for use as 2 filters with the Honeywell 40100 series air purifier .
That , at least , is the theory ...
In reality , the filter is perforated as advertised ; however , there is so much glue along the perforation holding the accordion folds together , that it is virtually impossible to break the filter in half .
I tried to break it by just flexing the perforation , as the directions indicated .
It did n't separate .
I tried flexing it harder and bending it back and forth to break them apart .
The glue started separating at the folds .
The glue coming apart caused the filter to open up at some of the accordion folds , so the filter was no longer round .
I tried a knife to cut the two filters apart .
Ditto on breaking up the accordion folds .
Finally resorted to a hacksaw to separate them .
The only bright thing of the whole fiasco - they did finally work when I crammed them into the units .
After effectively almost destroying the filters I called the manufacturer ( Honeywell ) and they indicated that these are not the filters that they sell .
They are an aftermarket item with the Honeywell logo .
Honeywell does not endorse them .
Surprise , surprise !
They recommended that you only buy the replacement HEPA filters sold on the Honeywell website for the model 40100 air cleaner .
I second that recommendation -- wholeheartedly !
