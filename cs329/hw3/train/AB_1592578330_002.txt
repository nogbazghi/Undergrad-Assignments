This review is of the 2nd edition , which I selected because it was the most recently published ( 2009 ) overview book available .
As anyone with FMS knows , the research and recommendations on this disease are changing rapidly .
Unfortunately , the bulk of this book was made up of things like "how to communicate with your family " and urges the reader to think of him/herself as a "fibromyalgia survivor" .
It has a more thorough discussion of alternative treatments than the actual research and scientific facts of fibromyalgia and almost no information about the latest pharmaceutical treatment options .
The " For Dummies " guide , although a couple years old , had more up-to-date and more comprehensive information on these topics .
