I bought this one because we have several at my work for sucking up graphite dust that is very fine and they take a lot of abuse !
Some of them are over 10 years old and still run great , i use it in our desert trailer for dust and sand , and at home for spider webs , they have an incredible amount of suction as long as you keep the filter cleaned out and they are very easy to use and clean , far superior to any other small vac ive ever used
