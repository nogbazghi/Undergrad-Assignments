This humidifier is completly over priced ( no matter where you purchase ) .
On the lowest setting , you are supposed to get 24 hours , but you get 12 at best .
It 's also obnoxiously loud .
Yes , it humidifies the room , but there are plently of other humidifers out there that are worth the $ you pay for them .
I should have done my research before purchasing this one .
