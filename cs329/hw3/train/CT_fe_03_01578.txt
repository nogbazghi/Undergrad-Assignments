Right .
Exactly .
Or to physically go and to get her a message or , you know , something like that .
' Cause if I would 've known -- I did n't even know that you could n't get up to where -- I knew you could n't get , you know , on the airline obviously .
But I thought , well , people will come off --
-- and then , you know -- you know how you saw it on TV where they hug and all that stuff , and I thought well , you know --
Right .
-- then ...
Yeah .
They cut all of that out .
Yeah .
I did n't know that until yesterday .
So , then it was we could n't even get past the atrium .
So ... But , I mean --
-- I understand it .
I just think that they need to --
-- have it better organized .
Right .
Uh-hum .
Yeah , I have n't flown since -- I 'd say I have n't flown for maybe about five or six years .
I just do n't really like flying on airplanes .
Uh-huh .
So , I try to stay away from it as much as I can , as much as I can I try to stay away from the airports , and I think since nine eleven it 's gotten a whole lot worse .
Just my whole security , my feeling of -- of security just is not there regarding the airports .
I do not -- like I said , I do n't know what they could do that would make me feel more secure in the airports .
I ca n't think so either because I was worrying anyway about the airplane crashing .
Right .
Now I have to worry about it either being blown in -- you know , up or driven into something and --
Mhm .
-- that 's just too -- I 'll just drive , you know , even if it 's long distance I would rather drive because then I 'm in control of my vehicle and I can , you know , keep secure because it 's my vehicle .
Right .
So , I do n't know either .
I think that that 's probably why a lot of people are n't flying .
Mhm .
And that --
Except for , like , business .
Yeah .
And even then I think that -- 'cause I just knew somebody who --
-- drove from , um , Philadelphia --
-- down to Atlanta instead of flying .
Right .
So , I mean , they would have to make it so that there were n't any incidents and -- but there 's , you know , incidents where people get guns on , you know , just to --
-- test the system , or knives , or -- I mean --
-- that 's more important than , you know , somebody having nail clippers .
Right .
Exactly .
Exactly .
And if they can -- if they can catch the nail clippers , why ca n't they catch the guns or the knives ?
