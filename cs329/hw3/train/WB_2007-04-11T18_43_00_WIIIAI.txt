Media Matters points out that while Bush in his immigration speech this week claimed that the decrease in arrests of illegal border-crossers proved that his policies have been effective â  â When you âre apprehending fewer people , it means fewer are trying to come acrossâ  â  in a November 2005 speech he cited increased arrests as proof of his policiesâ  effectiveness .
If you âre wondering , yes , if arrests neither increased nor decreased , that would also show that his policies were working .
Secretary of War Robert
and the always alliterative Peter Pace held a press conference about extending deployments from their current 12 months to 15 months , effective immediately .
Gates explained that this policy would âgive greater clarity and fairness .â 
Assuming your idea of clarity and fairness is to be stuck an additional 3 months in Iraq or Afghanistan while hostile locals shoot clearly and fairly at your ass .
Pace says that the increased length of combat will also increase quality of... quality of... quality of what now ? â[ T]hey will have a predictable life ; that they can sit there around the dinner table and know that on calendar month so - and-so , daddyâs going to leave , and on calendar month so-and-so , mommyâs going to come home , and those kinds of things , which add to quality of life .â 
And yes , that âs assuming mommy does nât come home a little bit earlier in a body bag .
And that the Pentagon does nât change its mind again , as Gates pointed out with clarity and fairness : âThat does not mean that something could not happen tomorrow that would cause our nation to need more of our armed forces to go do something different .â 
Maverick John âMaverickâ  McCain the Maverick gave a speech about Iraq at the Virginia Military Institute today ( Note : link is to the prepared remarks ) .
He said of his trip to Baghdad , â Unlike the veterans here today , I risked nothing more threatening than a hostile press corps .â 
That explains the body armor and military escort : he was afraid of an attack by Helen Thomas .
Well , fair enough .
He tried to portray himself as a realist about Iraq .
He distanced himself from âfalse optimism ,â  saying that he preferred to offer âersatz optimism .â 
Okay , he did nât .
He said , â I took issue with statements characterizing the insurgency as a few âdead-endersâ  or being in its âlast throes .ââ 
Sure you did , John .
Youâll notice heâs willing to criticize the false optimism of Rumsfeld or Cheney but not that of Bush .
Much of the speech was spent impugning the motives of politicians who oppose the war for seeking âthe expediency of easy but empty answers ,â  âthe allure of political advantage , â  and âthe temporary favor of the latest public opinion poll , â  and for engaging in âfanciful and self-interested debatesâ  and âgiddy anticipation of the next election .â 
Someone needs to ask him if itâs only Democratic politicians who are being base and cynical , or if that also applies to the majority of Americans who oppose the war .
âBefore I left for Iraq , I watched with regret as the House of Representatives voted to deny our troops the support necessary to carry out their new mission .
Democratic leaders smiled and cheered as the last votes were counted .
What were they celebrating ?
Defeat ?
Surrender ?
In Iraq , only our enemies were cheering .â 
He did say one thing that I entirely agree with : âIf fighting these people and preventing the export of their brand of radicalism and terror is not intrinsic to the national security and most cherished values of the United States , I donât know what is .â 
I agree : you donât know what is .
