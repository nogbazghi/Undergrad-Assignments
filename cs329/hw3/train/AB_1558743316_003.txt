This book has made me cry , laugh , and think about life clearly .
It touched my heart to read all those wonderful , soul inspiring stories .
When I 'm going through a rough time , I know that a good helping of chiken soup will warm me up and help me think over my problems .
Reading Chicken Soup For the Soul and A Second Helping has inspired me to read on until I bought your latest book , A fifth portion .
Bring on some more helpings !
