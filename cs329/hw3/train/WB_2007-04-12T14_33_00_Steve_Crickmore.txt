No nuance is too small to be left behind for Dubya..It turns out that it was a bodyguard in the security force that knows a little too much 'how to deal with these type of people ' who was the suicide bomber .
Unlike the president , my message to the Iraqi government , would be not to stand too close to such a security force .
