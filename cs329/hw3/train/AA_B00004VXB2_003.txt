I had this hand blender when it came with the stainless steel beaker cup ( which I did keep) , the plastic beaker , lid , chopper & 3 blades .
I loved all the gadgets & gizmos it came with .
It was very nice to start , but once I started chopping fresh fruits ...BOOM !
--Sounded like a gun went off !
It died .
Maybe they are different now ?
hmmm...sounds like the motor has n't improved too much though .
I 'll just stick with Cuisenart 's bar blender .
