Bush spoke to the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce today and was so excited that he interspersed his usual broken English with broken Spanish : âThursday , Laura and I are going to leave on a trip that will take us to Brazil and Uruguay and Colombia , y Guatemala , y por fin , Mexico .
... My message to those trabajadores y campesinos is , you have a friend in the United States of America .â 
He lectured the countries of the Western Hemisphere about what their governments need to do .
They should not âserve only the rich and the well-connected .â 
They should be âtransparent .â 
They should have no sense of irony about being instructed on these subjects by George W. Bush .
Further words of wisdom for our friends to the south : âLatin America needs capitalism for the campesinoâ .
âSocial justice means meeting basic needs .â 
