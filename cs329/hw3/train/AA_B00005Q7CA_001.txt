I 've had a Fein Turbo II vacuum for several years now and I like it a bunch .
But , I have never liked emptying and cleaning it , especially the hassle of cleaning the original cloth liner .
Now with this kit installed I get better filtration , excellent suction and easy emptying .
The dust bag is surprisingly large .
I 'm sure I will end up changing it more often than I cleaned the unit before simply because it is so much easier to do .
Even so , I doubt I will go through more than three or four bags per year in my use .
The extra expense is worth it both for convenience and for minimizing the amount of dust in the air .
I 'm constantly battling with dust in my woodshop for obvious reasons .
This helps !
My only complaint is that there are absolutely no instructions included with the kit .
Luckily it is n't hard to figure out , but you would think that they could have tossed a simple one page instruction sheet in the box .
