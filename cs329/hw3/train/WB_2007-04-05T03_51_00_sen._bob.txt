It 's actually " HUA" , or it was back in the day .
It was always shouted and actually means " Heard , Understood , Agreed .
HUA.
Typical Sarge would say " Tomorrow 0400 we have to go outside the wire . "
Grunts reply " HUA" , but the actual response did differ .
"FTA" is what we 'd reply .
It means " Fuck The Army " .
