" And people are slaughtered daily because we chose this limited man over all others to lead us . "
Uh , no .
People have been slaughtered daily under a number of U.S. presidents .
The fundamental issue to me is the unquestioning acceptance of militarism .
Combine that with a strong dose of arrogance and ignorance inculcated in the general population and it really does n't matter who the figurehead is , the U.S. military ( and/or CIA ) will be out slaughtering innocents somewhere .
( I am not meaning to imply these problems are unique to the United States .
It is the United States ' current pre-eminent economic and military position which leads to the danger . )
