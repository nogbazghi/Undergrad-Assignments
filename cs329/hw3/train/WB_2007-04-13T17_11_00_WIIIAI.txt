Dick Cheney spoke to the Heritage Foundation in Chicago today , possibly the last place on earth where repeatedly accusing the Democrats of returning to the policies of McGovern and the âhard left in the early â70sâ  would have any sort of traction .
However , he insisted , âAmerica will not again play out those old scenes of abandonment , and retreat , and regret .
Thirty-five years is time enough to have learned the lessons of that sad era .
When the United States turns away from our friends , only tragedy can followâ .
So Cheney not only wants never-ending war in Iraq , he thinks we should still be fighting the Vietnam War .
He returned to the attack against Nancy Pelosi : â No member of Congress , Democrat or Republican , has any business jetting around the world with a diplomatic agenda contrary to that of the President and the Secretary of State .â 
Dude , the president and the secretary of state have a diplomatic agenda ?
He calls that demand that congresscritters refrain from talking to foreigners âa basic constitutional principle .â 
On the Iraq spending bill , he said , âRarely in history has an elected branch of government engaged in so pointless an exercise as Congress is now doing .â 
I was going to ask if it was as pointless as the war in Iraq that the executive branch is engaged in , but then I realized he said elected branch of government ...
He accuses the Congressional Democrats of âendlessly shifting positionsâ  on Iraq , but how consistent is Cheney himself ?
He said , â We offer a vision of freedom , justice , and self government as a superior alternative to ideologies of violence , anger , and resentment .â 
Dick Cheney was for violence , anger and resentment before he was against them .
Iâm pretty sure âViolence , Anger and Resentmentâ  was the Bush-Cheney 2004 campaign slogan .
