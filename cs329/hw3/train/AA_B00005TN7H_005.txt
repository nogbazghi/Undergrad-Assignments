Very pleased , I 've had absolutely no problems with this product .
I think the point should be emphasized that you only need one of them to do all your jars .
I had n't realized that when I first looked into the product and had thought you needed an adaptor for every jar .
One is all you need and they work like a charm .
No one makes the point that you need to seal the jar with the ring after you have sealed the lid .
Seems obvious , but needs to be said .
