I am a music therapist in Kansas City and also a mom to a 3 year old and 1 year old .
This book gets as much use in the classroom as it does at home !
I teach special needs children ages 3-12 and I have used this book and the accompanying recording in all my classes .
Several teachers have purchased the book themselves !
My own children love the songs and and the signs .
I get frequent requests at school and at home for the Baby Sing and Sign !
