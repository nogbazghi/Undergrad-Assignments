Ok , I have had my upright for about 3 years and go through a belt a month .
I have it in right , and even took it to the shop to let them put it in , and it still breaks or burns up in a month .
I do n't blame it entirely on just the belt , I 'm sure the sweeper plays a part .<p>Minus the shipping charges , Amazon does have a good price on them .
