I got two falls out of this leaf-vac before the little male-plastic bar that holds the fan/hand unit into the blowers female part broke as I cleared the 20th jam of the day today and tried to hook the unit back together .
Before it broke ...it was heavy even empty and bulky to maneuver .
It jammed very easy at the narrow hole from the machine to the bag .
The bag was always flying off my shoulder no matter how I adjusted the strap .
I give it a positive review for the blowing action .
It blows grass off the driveway and walkway good .
When it was n't jamming it sucked very dry
loose leaves up .
It jams on bunches and god forbid there is a little moisture on them .
Won't buy a B&D replacement .
