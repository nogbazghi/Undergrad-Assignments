Hornby has already proven his mastery of the male ego in High Fidelity and About a Boy .
In A Long Way Down he tackles the often taboo topic of suicide and nails it !
A Long Way Down is a work that is nearly impossible to create .
At it 's core it 's a book centered around the issue of suicide and getting through life when life is absolutely miserable .
However , the book is packed with realistic humor and is anything but depressing !
Hornby also does n't take the easy way out with any of his characters to create a "fairy tale " like book .
It 's real , entertaining and all together surprisingly uplifting !
Read it !
