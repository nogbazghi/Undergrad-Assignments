So on the day we learn that Walter Reed patients have been ordered not to speak to the press , Bush met with some âsocial entrepreneurs who have decided to help improve the lives of our servicemen and women and their families ,â  by , for example , entrepreneurially âhelping the chaplains help kids , or ... helping a family of the injuredâ .
For example , the person in charge of the project giving families life-size cardboard âflat soldiersâ  was there .
They told George some stories : âOne of the most enjoyable things I do as the President is to hear stories of my fellow citizens -- stories of compassion , stories of care .â 
So glad heâs enjoying himself .
So glad he thinks of amputees and brain-damaged soldiers as characters in stories .
And supporting characters at that .
âIâm proud to be the President of a country with so many decent citizens .â 
Once again , he seems to think that only Americans are decent .
Speaking of decent citizens , you âll have heard of the background briefing held on Air Force Two by a Senior Administration Official whose name could not be used , who said , âIâve seen some press reporting says , âCheney went in to beat up on them , threaten them .â 
Thatâs not the way I work .
... But the idea that Iâd go in and threaten someone is an invalid misreading of the way I do business .â 
The SAO reported on ( or possibly gave a valid misreading of ) his meeting with Karzai , who he said was âupbeatâ  because the US is going to give him lots of money and yet more troops .
SAO made it abundantly clear that the sole basis of Karzaiâs authority is American backing , and that it always has been : â He told a story to the group there about -- this was the immediate aftermath of 9/11 -- about meeting with a group of tribal elders in one of the remote parts of Afghanistan .
He was trying to get them organized to participate in going after the Taliban and governing Afghanistan .
And he said the only question they wanted to ask me was , is the United States with you .â 
SAO does nât even realize that thereâs anything problematic about that .
The SAO warned that Karzai is a crashing bore : âYou sit down and talk with Karzai , heâll talk about the history of Pashtun rule in the region for 500 years .
He can tell you what the Durand Treaty was all about between Afghanistan and India in 1889 or whenever it was , and why that âs important to todayâs conflict and so forth .â 
Will this be on the test ?
No, sadly none of the reporters dared to follow this up by asking the SAO to explain what he â  or she ! â  learned about what the Durand Treaty ( of 1893 ) was all about and why itâs important to todayâs conflict and so forth .
