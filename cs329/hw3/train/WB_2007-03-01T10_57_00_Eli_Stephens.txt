The word "now " in the final sentence is unfortunately not valid , as proven by the case of the Cuban Five , now in the ninth year of imprisonment in the U.S. for " crimes " very similar to those of the Alvarezes , suggests .
Actually the Cuban Five are even more tragic than the Alvarezes , since their spying on the exile community was done not just for general information gathering , but for preventing acts of terrorism which have claimed more than 3000 Cuban and other lives over the years .
If you look back at coverage of the Alvarez case on my blog , you 'll find that they committed such nefarious acts of "espionage " as reporting the visit of the President of FIU to the White House .
