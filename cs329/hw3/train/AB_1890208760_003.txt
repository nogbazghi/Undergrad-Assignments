This book is an outstanding mystery with plot turns as intricate as Byzantium 's court intrigue and with such seamless detail the reader cannot tell what is fiction and what history .
I call it amazing because the reader is not only swept into the larger currents of life as the old gods fell to the new but also such minute detail , one is living it with the characters .
The pacing is excellent for an exciting read and the sense of place beautifully crafted .
I seldom read historical mysteries ; I 'm delighted I made an exception here .
