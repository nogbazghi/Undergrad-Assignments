I absolutely enjoy this set .
I was a bit worried when I first used them because they did stick .
However after a couple of uses they are completely non-stick .
They are durable , amazing the handles do n't get hot , after use , pour water in them and let them soak for a little while and everything wipes right out and they cook evenly ( which is something I have never found in any other set ) .
Love them ! ! !
