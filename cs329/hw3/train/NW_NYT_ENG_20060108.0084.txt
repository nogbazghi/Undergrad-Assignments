Six months from graduation day , students in California 's
high school Class of 2006 finally know for certain what
it takes to graduate .
Students in the Class of 2006 and beyond must pass an
exit exam in reading and math to get a diploma .
State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O'Connell announced Friday that he
will not support any "alternative assessments " as a substitute for
passing the exam .
Instead , he will work to expand continuing
education options for students who do not pass the exam
but otherwise are on track to graduate .
This is the right stance .
The state does a serious disservice
by giving diplomas to students who do n't have basic reading
and writing skills .
O'Connell looked at "alternative assessments " across the nation and found that
none guarantees knowledge of the reading and math skills tested
in the exit exam .
They also undermine the idea of
a uniform high school diploma .
Certainly , California has to deal with students who have special issues ,
such as English learners and special-education students .
For example , a
student who arrives in California schools in 10th grade not
speaking English may need extra time .
The same is true
for special-education students , particularly those already successfully spending 80 percent
of their time in regular instruction .
As O'Connell puts it , " It simply means that their basic education
is not complete and they must continue on through our
K-12 system , adult education or community colleges to obtain the
necessary skills to warrant receipt of a diploma . "
O'Connell will present a package of continuing education options to the
Legislature .
The Class of 2006 -- and legislators -- should
hear O'Connell 's words loud and clear : " We will not turn
our backs on you , " but we will hold you to
high standards .
