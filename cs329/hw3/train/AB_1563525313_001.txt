It 's about time somebody wrote a book on helping parents understand that yelling does more harm than good .
The author teaches the parent communication skills , and that 's how the child will respond positively to the initiations from the parent .
A peaceful environment is so much better than the hostile power play of yelling .
This is a great book every parent should read .
Another book that I highly recommend as it teaches parents that often frustrating situations evolve because of a lack of love , self-esteem and an identity crisis in the child and the parent , is Dietmar Scherf 's " I Love Me : Avoiding and Overcoming Depression " which is also available at Amazon .
