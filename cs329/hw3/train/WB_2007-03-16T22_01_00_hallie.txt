Maybe PETA needs a better PR approach , still the pictures
are disturbing as is a video sponsored by Pamela Anderson showing KFC chicken farming and slaughter - really gruesome .
I do n't think I 'll be buying any KFC in the foreseeable future .
Besides , eating the meat of a tortured being could be very bad juju .
Upon looking up your old post on this subject , I found :
" I paid $ 1.93 a gallon for gasoline today and so am now wholly behind a war for oil . "
taken from your post of Feb. 2003..jest , I take it .
