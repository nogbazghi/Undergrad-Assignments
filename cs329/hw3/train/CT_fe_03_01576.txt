Mhm .
Um , uh , right .
And , uh , you know , I also think that with your idea of the , um , questionnaire is that certainly when people decide -- you know , people are always very , um -- oh , I do n't know -- they -- if you give people a choice , like if you just present them with a , um -- a yellow wall --
Mhm .
-- and you say , " Here you go , here 's your wall " they 're not as , um -- I do n't know -- positive about it as if you get a group of -- g- -- of people together and you say , " Okay , let 's choose what color we 're gonna paint this wall " --
Right .
-- and if ...
That 's where a questionnaire comes in then .
Exactly .
Right .
You see what I 'm saying ?
It makes them feel as if they 've ...
They will come in -- yeah , they will come in and they would see this and they would say , " Oh , my God ! You 're giving me a choice here " .
Right ?
And how many peoples come through , and how many airports actually allow to have this kind of thing to make things better for them ?
You know what I mean ?
Mhm .
Because there 's some people that travel at least maybe give or take twenty five to twenty six times out of a year on a plane , for business or pleasure , or i- in between , right ?
Mhm .
So , if -- can you imagine out of those twenty six times , or whatever it might be , every time you turn around you get [inaudible ] pants pulled down , you 've got to go to get through the scanners .
Well , the scanners is for your own benefit and your own protection --
Mhm .
-- to know that somebody coming through there with a -- a gun --
Mhm .
-- or ...
And then the other -- the -- to -- to be scanned down in the metal detector to make sure that there 's nothing there .
These things are for your benefit , which is understandable .
But , however , to say , " I 'm coming -- I -- I wanna know how you feel about it " means a whole lot .
Right .
You know ?
It means -- it means a whole -- whole lot and everything else and stuff .
But , however , also the smart thing to do is also go with the security and have -- have -- and see how do they feel about it .
Mhm .
Okay .
What could be brought better ?
What could make them better than what they is ?
Right .
Without hurting anybody ?
Right .
You know ?
Or invading anyone 's , uh , you know , privacy .
Not -- not even just privacy , but their personal dignity I think is almost more --
Right .
-- you know , that 's more insulting than invading your privacy I think .
If I -- if I have a purse that I 'm carrying and I have nothing to hide --
