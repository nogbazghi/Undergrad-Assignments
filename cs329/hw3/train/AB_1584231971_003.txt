I recently purchased this book about a month ago , and I was very pleased with the quality of the photographs this book had .
I was also surprised that some of the producers featured in the book had a lot smaller set ups than I imagined .
So , it 's actually good for the up and comers , that are on a budget to see that , just because you do n't have million dollar equipment , does n't mean you ca n't make million dollar records .
