What a lousy book .
After giving it three tries , I trashed it .
The book did n't help me one bit in using VC++ .
Coming from intermediate VB6 experience with experience in Win32 Perl programming and a rusty and casual knowledge of the C/C++ language , I was looking for a book that will teach me how to use VC++ IDE.
What a waste of time .
I hate books like these .
You 're in , say , chapter ten and the example application you 're supposed to have done several chapters ago *with the stupid wizard* is needed .
First , I do n't want to use the damn wizards .
What ever happened to building applications from the ground up ?
Anybody can use the wizard .
But what about afterwards ?
What if you do n't want to ?
Second , I do n't care about what was taught several chapter 's ago .
I want what 's in the present chapter of interest !
I want to build an interactive UI , like I can do with VB so easily .
Perhaps going through ALL the chapters *in sequence* I would have learned *something* .
If I were to do that , I might as well take a class instead .
I tried the first five chapters in sequence and then tried to skip around and learned that this book [is n't for me] .
Look for a another book if you 're the type who likes to use books like a reference guide .
If you 're the type who reads cover to cover and do n't mind doing every example and exercise so you can continue onto future chapters , then this book is for you .
