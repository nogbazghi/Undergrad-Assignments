Having recently been converted to the Low Carb life by Gary Taube 's excellent and life-changing book - Good Calories , Bad Calories Good Calories , Bad Calories - I 've been interested in finding cookbooks that would increase my range of food choices while staying within a healthy ( for me ) daily carb count of less than 40 net carbs .
This book is n't it .
As an earlier reviewer noted , a book that uses flour , cornstarch , sugar or regular chocolate , etc . in almost every recipe is NOT low carb .
Which is why , no doubt , the serving sizes listed are laughably miniscule .
ONE egg for breakfast ?
I think not .
Worse , I do n't believe any of the carb counts in this book can be trusted .
Here 's the carb count for "nut butter spreads " ( made from 2 cups of peanuts for example ) on page 56 , the serving size for which is 2 tablespoons : 0 grams carbohydrate .
Here 's the carb count for "homemade peanut butter " ( made from 2 cups of peanuts ) on page 250 , the serving size for which is 2 tablespoons : 7 grams carbohydrate ; 5 net grams .
Huh ?
Some plain chicken recipes have carb counts of 1 or 2 grams - yet a serving of plain roasted chicken has 6 grams per serving !
Bottom Line : If you 're looking for real low carb recipes save your money and look elsewhere .
All this book will do is reduce your bank account and expand your waist .
