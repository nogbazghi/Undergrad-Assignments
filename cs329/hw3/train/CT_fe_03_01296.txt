And I -- go ahead .
Oh , no , no , no .
I think the site without commercial is good .
Yes , it is .
Or is -- or you --
I mean , they give things .
They say this is sponsored by or , you know --
Oh , right .
-- they provided the funding , but we do n't have commercials otherwise .
Okay .
Except two times a year they ask for money .
Oh .
And they want you to s - send in money .
Well , in Great Britain , for example , if you wanna listen to the radio stations , you have to pay , uh , a fee .
Mhm .
And they go around trying to find out who has n't paid their fee .
Okay .
But then they do n't have advertising .
I see .
But this one they just want people to give money .
But I like it because it provides in depth coverage --
Okay .
-- and , uh , it 's just -- and it -- they try to make it as non biased as possible .
Obviously you ca n't do that .
I see .
But , uh , that 's how I get my -- most of my news .
Okay .
And then the rest is from reading the newspaper .
Okay .
And from go - -- oh , yeah , I go online , too .
Yeah .
That 's quickest way --
Yes .
-- to go online and -- and -- and search whatever you want , right .
Right .
And I 'll tell you , when you go on , I have , uh , one site that you might like to see .
Oh , good .
This one is funny .
Oh .
Or it 's strange , we 'll put it that way .
It 's called the obscure store and reading room , and I 'm going to it right now .
Okay .
And I 'll -- I 'll give you the thing .
It 's W.W.W.
Yes .
Dot obscure , O.B.S.C.U.R.E.
Mhm .
Store , S.T.O.R.E.
dot com .
Okay .
And they have all the strange news --
Oh .
-- that people send in .
Some of it is pretty awful .
Some of it is nice .
Uh-huh .
But there are just silly , crazy things .
It says -- one of them , the titles is , " Americans have gone absolutely crazy for the word 'absolutely '" .
Um , oh , here 's another one that has to do with the business today , and it 's really -- some of these are stupid , but , " French cleaners goes up in flames .
Fire chief wo n't call it arson " .
Because it 's got the name " French" .
Okay .
I mean , but there are just other ones -- uh , here 's another woman that she survives a second , uh , twister .
In other words , um , not a cyclone , it 's a -- I ca n't even -- tornado , to hit her home in three years .
Uh-huh .
I mean , so it 's got a lot of stuff .
