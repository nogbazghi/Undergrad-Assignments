The world of Jesus Christ was hardly static .
Uprisings , rebellions , and subversive groups popped up all of the time , especially in Jewish lands where Roman occupation was equal to slavery in the eyes of most Jewish people .
This made rebellion almost a religious duty even though many of the religious authorities did not share this point of view .
Some of the rebellious groups had limited success , others had disastrous ends .
Bandits , Prophets , and Messiahs helps the reader understand the different movements in the days of Jesus and help modern readers understand why Jesus ' message was so controversial , not just in terms of content , but politically and socially as well .
The author looks at the historical realities of the Jewish people and the connection with religious and political figures that sprung up in the Roman Empire , particularly in Palestine , in the days of Jesus Christ and in the early New Testament days .
Readers are able to distinguish those who might be "rebels without a cause " so to speak , and legitimate groups that had serious religious and/or political objectives .
The author culled much of the information from lectures given to students which gives the work a scholarly feel in an accessible manner .
The book contains a scripture cited index which will help readers who may be students researching a topic , preachers preparing a sermon or homily , or person who is fascinated by the background to the Bible .
