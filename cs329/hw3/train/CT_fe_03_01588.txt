Now , maybe money has to do with that but then if it is the -- the case then it goes back to what we were b - both just saying , you know , money has a lot to do with it .
Right , yeah , yeah .
You know , so I do n't know .
But I do n't know -- I do n't know -- I mean , I c - -- about me not being a traveler , I guess if I had to fly tomorrow I --
Mhm .
-- would be a little bit more --
-- not nervous , maybe --
Yeah .
-- apprehensive because -- because of nine eleven --
You have to leave about two , three hours in advance --
Right .
-- just to stand in line .
And I think all that new security stuff is just going to become a big headache too .
Mhm .
Just a big inconvenience for everybody .
Yeah .
Necessary .
I think they only had like eleven marshals for -- for the entire United States to be traveling around on planes so , you know --
Wow .
-- a whole bunch of planes that these marshals are n't on .
Mhm .
And now the government does n't want to give pilots guns .
Right .
Right .
You know , so I do n't know --
Yeah .
-- we 'll -- we 'll see about that .
I think some -- some airports are doing it or something like that .
Mhm , yeah .
But it 's -- it 's hard -- that 's a -- that 's a tough cookie to -- to -- to crack .
You know , how do you make sure you 're secure , especially in something that -- that 's so important --
Mhm .
-- and -- and we 've got no guarantees that they wo n't try that again .
Yeah .
Just like the guy who got on the plane with the bomb in his shoes .
Mhm .
Now , who would 've thought to check somebody 's shoes , you know ?
Definitely , definitely .
Because they are so determined that they can go to any measure and it 's like , right we have to outsmart them --
Mhm .
-- in our thinking .
Ah , yeah .
It 's crazy .
It is definitely crazy and maybe it has a lot to do with our relations with Arab and Americans but also Arabs , uh , in other countries .
Mhm .
Because Arabs definitely hate us , or rather , uh , uh , uh , Muslims -- a lot of Muslims in other countries they -- they definitely hate our guts .
They sure do , yeah .
You know ?
Yeah .
In some -- some ways , uh , you know , we -- we do n't know -- I -- I mean I 'm down with my country one hundred percent --
Mhm .
-- but in reality we really do n't know what our country does to other people .
Exactly .
You know , I mean ?
