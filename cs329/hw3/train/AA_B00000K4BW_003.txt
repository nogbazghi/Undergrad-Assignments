Ive had this fridge for about 3 yrs now - i got this when i was 17 or 18 and it still works great and is worth the money .
Its perfect for teenager or college students dorm .
Ive had this in the bedroom since then and i have gotten compliments on it and how cool it was and its good to store some drinks and you can have a decent amount of food or other things in there but it is perfect size for the bedroom but inside it is small to medium storage capacity - but for its smallness it is very powerful and keeps drinks and other things ice cold and also comes with a little freezer compartment which is also very powerful- id say it can hold about a case of drinks or case and half and some room for food - its better for storing drinks .
But overall good little fridge with lots of power and nice silver design .
