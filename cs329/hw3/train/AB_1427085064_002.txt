After years of dieting , deprivation , and disappointment , I had run out of both willpower and motivation .
When I bought this book/cd , I figured I had reached my "final frontier " ; if this method did n't work , I was going to throw in the towel and give up .
Guess what folks !
It works !
And it 's subtle and gentle and effortless .
I really like effortless !
The side effects : happiness and better sleep.
And of course , weight loss , and good eating habits .
Try it .
This is one of the best things that ever happened to yours truly .
I hope it will be true for you too .
