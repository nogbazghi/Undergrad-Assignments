When are people going to realize that this lying sleazebag is the only reason we are in Iraq ?
There should be no debate about further funding of this illegal invasion .
He lied to start the invasion .
Is that not treason , which last time I checked was a crime ?
Why should this administration be given money to further an illegal invasion ?
There should be no more money for his crimes !
The debate should be how fast can we put Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld , and the rest of the neocons in jail .
