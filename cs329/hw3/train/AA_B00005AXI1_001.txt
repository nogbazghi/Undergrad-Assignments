Just got this vacuum today and am already in love with it .
We have a large 16 gallon vacuum for the shop that is very loud and cumbersome to move around .
This little vacuum is very quiet by comparison and I love the long hose that reaches easily to my work bench .
Just exactly what I was looking for .
Have it connected to my power saw with a plug that turns them both on at the same time and I am more than pleased .
