... and advertise on the Internet when they 're showing the advertisements from the Super Bowl after the Super Bowl is over .
So ads about the ads ?
Ads during the ads .
Did you follow that ?
You get that ?
It 's getting serious ( ph ) now .
Not even a little .
ELA
OK .
So here 's what 's going do happen .
Let 's say you 're Budweiser and you have a commercial during the Super Bowl .
Everyone is going to want to go see which one was the best .
I mean , the Super Bowl ads have taken on a life of their own .
So here 's one .
The crabs have got some Buds .
They 're happy , living it up .
So if you look at a commercial like this , people are going to log on to look at the commercials again the next day .
So Web sites like YouTube , any Web site like that that 's showing commercials and having these polls can show ads before they show the ads , and so they make more money off of people advertising , waiting for people to see this .
Wait a minute .
So you have to see an ad to see an ad ?
Exactly .
But you want to see the second ad .
You got that ?
Yes .
I think I follow .
Yes .
But also , it 's good for , let 's say , NBC , which can go ahead and show ads on the Web sites that are showing the Super Bowl ads , because since the Super Bowl is on CBS , they ca n't show their lineup during that time , but they actually can do it online .
So it gives some people -- some companies a broader pass here .
They could save some money by just forgetting the football game and just do the ads .
Oh , I would vote for that .
A lot of people would do that , and the halftime show .
And then ...
That 's it , yes .
Did n't it sound like the playoff games were more like the Super Bowl anyway ?
So...
All right .
All right , Stephanie .
Thank you .
Sure .
I think my head hurts .
