I find it hard to believe that any experienced roleplayer would find this boxed set challenging .
It has no new monsters and no surprises .
What it has , in spades , is one of the cheapest and weakest monsters in the genre : the kobold : poor cousin of the goblin .
Sure , maybe they can cast spells or gang up on you , but face it : They are physically weak .
Easy to defeat .
Especially against a group of seasoned players .
I was highly disappointed .
I do not recommend that you buy this product .
It is a waste of time and money .
