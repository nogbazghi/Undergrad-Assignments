Darkness Falls is pure melodrama .
There is a good guy , the misled gal , the comic relief guy , the evil guy , and the really-really evil guy .
The only difference between this book and a book written a century earlier is that the really-really evil guy does n't have a big black moustache .
The premise is the threat of a world without petroleum .
The misled gal develops a bacteria that eats oil .
She is fighting for the rights of the Alaskan caribou .
The really-really evil guy wants to take the world back to a pre-Industrial Age and therefore sets the oil-eating bacteria loose in the oilfields of the world .
The good guy has to find the really-really evil guy ( and also his boy wonder mildly evil guy ) and stop said guys from destroying civilization as we know it .
Misled girl adds some love interest and in the end , she works with good guy even though it was all her doing that started the mess .
Comic relief guy plays his part superbly .
On completion of the book , I more or less said to myself , " A really interesting premise .
But I just could n't get myself involved with any of the characters . "
Almost all the situations were predictable , even the morality play ending .
In short , this ai n't literature but it 's an interesting read that passes some time and does n't require the reader to wonder about anything .
That being said , I have to wonder how another author might handle the same theme .
