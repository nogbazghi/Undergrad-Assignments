I do n't use this product to clean a humidifier but as a cleaning product .
It takes hard water off of any surface like you would not believe .
I sprinkle a little of this on on get some on a toothbrush .
It bubbles and just eats away the hard water .
You can then rub it with the toothbrush and it will general vanish .
Love this stuff , I 've been using it to clean sinks , tubs , toilets , etc for many years .
