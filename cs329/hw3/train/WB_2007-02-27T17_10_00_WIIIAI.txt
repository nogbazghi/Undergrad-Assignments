This morning Bush met with Tony Saca , a minor character on The Sopranos the president of El Salvador .
â We spent a lot of time talking together , because I value the advice of the President ,â  George said , which leads me to wonder how much time ADD Boy considers to be a lot of time , given that he made this comment at 9:51 a.m.
I also wonder how much of that time Bush was exercising his linguistic skills .
He began their photo-op , âBienvenidos a mi amigo , Presidente de nuestro amigo de El Salvador .
Gracias .â 
Bush âexpressed my concerns and our condolences about the three gentlemen who were recently assassinatedâ .
Four , actually , but I guess the driver was nât a âgentleman , â  unlike the son of the guy who ordered an archbishop murdered .
Later in the day he met with the Miami Heat .
Thatâs a basketball team , evidently .
At one point he said , â I want to say something to the spouses of the players .
Welcome .
Youâve got a tough life in many ways with your spouse on the road all the time , and you deserve as much of this championship as they do . â 
He said âspouseâ  rather than wives , although Iâm guessing they were all wives , because heâs used to saying the exact same thing about spouses of military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan .
His basketball skills are on a par with his Spanish-language skills .
At 11 minutes into this video he attempts to dribble a basketball .
In between those events , there was some dreary swearing-in ceremony he had to sit through .
So bored .
So bored .
Although at the end a thought seems to have perked him up a bit , possibly , âAh bet Condiâll be real impressed if ah show her mah mad hoopball skills at that photo-op with Big Shaq .
Ah call him Big Shaq .â 
