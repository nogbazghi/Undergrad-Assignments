I have nothing but good things to say about this cleaner .
I have cats and was just using Clorox 2 and paper towels before .
I ca n't believe the gunk this thing picks up ( I still use paper towels to pick up the globs before using the machine ) .
It 's everthing I wanted .
Highly recommended for anyone serious about being clean .
Love it ! ! !
Ironically , I 've discovered Science Diet Hairball Control cat food and so far , no more puking !
But I know I 'll still be needing my Dirt Devil .
It 's worth every penny ! !
