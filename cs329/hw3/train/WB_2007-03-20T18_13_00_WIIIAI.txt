Today , Bush went to a Ford assembly plant in Missouri at which they make hybrid SUVs and suchlike .
Iâve always assumed that Bushâs grammar is so bad in part because he never actually listens when other people speak and thereby learns how English am to be spoken , but mostly because heâs lazy and sloppy and canât think two words ahead .
From this speech , for example , âit makes sense for us to promote that kind of technologiesâ  and âitâs now becoming in the marketplaceâ  and âin a relatively quick period of time .â 
Sloppy .
Here , though , he actually stops and uncorrects himself : âMy impressions are -- is that American automobile companies are essential to keeping us competitiveâ .
Simple pleasures for simple minds : â I enjoyed walking up and down the line , shaking peopleâs hands .â 
He said that one way to reduce gas use 20 % in 10 years â  â I call it Twenty Tenâ  â  is âto encourage consumption of hybrid automobiles .â 
Theyâre delicious with steak sauce .
Although theyâre not exactly âzero emissions ,â  if you know what I mean .
He wisely informed the plant workers , âRemember , oil is the feedstock for gasoline .â 
âIt may sound far-fetched to some that one of these days weâll be making a product that can go into a Ford pickup truck out of wood chipsâ .
Wait , is the fuel made out of wood chips , or the pickup truck ?
He finds himself sooooo interesting : âItâs really interesting , is nât it , for the President to be talking about one of these days people driving pickup trucks driven by ethanol -- fueled by ethanol from wood chips ?
Is it real ?
I think it is .
Otherwise I would nât be standing here talking to you about it .â 
Well , Iâm convinced .
