Holy Joe Lieberman hang-doggedly warned today that the non-binding resolution will turn into a constitutional crisis , âan escalating battle that threatens to consume our government over many months ahead , a battle that will neither solve the sprawling challenges we face in Iraq nor strengthen our nation to defeat the enemies of our security throughout the world from Islamist extremists .â 
In other words â  and I suspect you âre all way ahead of me here â  exactly like the war in Iraq .
He said that the resolution âproposes nothing .â 
He said it âis a strategy of âno ,â  while our soldiers are saying , âyes , sirâ  to their commanding officers as they go forward into battle .â 
Um , yeah , that âs kinda the point .
He finished with a call to âreach out to one another to find that measure of unity that can look beyond todayâs disagreements and secure the nationâs future and the future of all who will follow us as Americans .â 
Which is the emptiest of empty rhetoric since he , to borrow a phrase , proposes nothing , signally failing to describe what measure of unity can be found between rabid militarists like himself and , you know , sane people .
The White House response to the resolution pointed out that even if Congress does nât support Bushâs âsurge , â  âThis plan enjoys the support of the Iraqi government and U.S. military leadership , including Gen . David Petraeusâ .
And as we know , the United States Constitution states that âthe government of the United States shall consist of three branches , the ( Iraqi ) Executive , the ( dirty hippy ) Legislative , and the US military leadership , including Gen . David Petraeus .â 
