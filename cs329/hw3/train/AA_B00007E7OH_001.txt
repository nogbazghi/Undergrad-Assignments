Both of these belts broke on the first day .
The previous belt had lasted over a year .
I thought these would be better , since their labeled as Extended wear .
I picked up some cheap ones ( not Eureka brand )at walmart , and they are fine .
I guess EXT means extra thick , which also means less pliable .
Maybe it was just a bad batch , but I 'll stick to off brand from now on .
