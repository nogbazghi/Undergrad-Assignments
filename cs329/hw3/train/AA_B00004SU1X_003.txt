The best coffee maker I have owned !
I 've tried a variety of moderatly priced coffee makers , but until now I was never satisfied .
It keeps coffee warm for hours , and with the flexibility of steamed milk , you have a variety of drink options .
It is well designed and easy to use .
A really great product .
