Mhm .
Um and I personally , I -- I value um ... I believe in , you know , an afterlife um ...
Right .
... and I believe that , you know , the relationships that we establish now will be carried over in an afterlife , so with that in mind , um ... you know , if we need that person in heaven you know , years from now --
Yeah .
-- or whenever , you know ?
I think that we 'll look back on the times that we had here on earth and we 'll think to ourselves , well , you know , " I 'm really sorry for the way I treated you and I 'm really sorry that I did n't do this and did n't do that " .
I would -- I would rather um , live with no regrets as much as possible than to have money and a million dollars .
And granted too , I mean , that can go tomorrow .
If I knew exactly where to spend that million dollars ...
Exactly .
A million is n't that much in today 's world .
Exactly .
I mean , a person over their lifetime will make more than a willion -- oh , more than a million dollars but .
Exactly .
You know , they just wo n't make it at one time and ...
Right .
Um ... yeah .
Uh --
To me ... mhm ?
You go ahead .
Okay .
Um ... well , I guess it 's back to , you know , what I -- what I was thinking about ... I 've known some of the most kindest , nicest people that had almost nothing .
Yeah .
And uh , that really teaches you a lot um ... and it shows you that money is not everything .
Like , when I went to this third world country , of course I never left the US before and I was thinking to myself , " Oh , man , I 'm so glad to , you know , get out of the US" and everything --
Uh-huh .
-- and experience something new and I saw a lot of poverty around me but one thing I saw too was that these people loved their families .
Right .
And even though they had little , they were w- with their families every night , the husbands provided for the wives , the wives worked just as hard as the husbands , um , the children were always smiling for the most part and uh ... that -- that just says a lot and I think too , in their mind , they would never trade anything for that .
Exactly .
Like , some of these people , you know , they work really hard and sure , they could have gone to the city and gotten themselves , you know , high paying jobs and uh , gotten an education , gotten degrees and really , really tried to work hard but then , what would they have had ?
Right .
They would have had less time with their families .
