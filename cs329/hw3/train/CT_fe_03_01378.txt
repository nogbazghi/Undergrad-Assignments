-- you know , um , but they 're -- they 're trying to [inaudible ] they 're trying to stay away from now , uh , violence .
Mhm .
But , you know what ?
-- an- and it 's really strange .
You ca n't stay away from violence because , like we said , Romeo and Juliet --
Mhm .
-- there 's violence in that book .
Right .
You know , and it -- it seems like there 's violence , there 's sex in -- in all the books and , see , when I was growing up , because I come from a -- a service background , um , half the time I was in public school , the other half I was in private school --
Mhm .
-- you know , in -- but in private school , um , I was dealing with a lot more , of , ah , religious materials --
Right .
-- opposed to , you know , um , there 's a log- -- there 's a logical , you know , um , books and stuff like that , like , you know , we were n't in -- in private school we were n't allowed to read To Kill a Mocking Bird .
Mhm .
You know , and -- and , uh , public school is yes , um , but it -- it 's really hard , you know , um , to say , because I know , you know , the curriculum nowadays is a lot -- is getting to be a lot more strict --
Right , and --
-- ah , but they 're trying to stay away from the violence --
Mhm --
-- you know .
-- and people 's standards are different , too .
Um , --
Yeah .
-- it 's just like , you know , some -- some families will allow their kids to listen to , you know , violent sounding music for example --
Mhm .
-- um , whereas , you know , other families , you know , they stay away from that completely .
Right .
And , ah , you know , it 's a lot of -- a lot of issues to look at .
Um , I think when it comes to reading materials , um , in the public school system I think there should be a whole lot more parent teacher , um , communication in regards to things like that , um , --
Ye- yeah .
As far as parent teachers , uh , you know , the- them talking , it 's a lot easier to do that --
Mhm .
-- when your child is at elementary school --
Yeah .
-- and -- and junior high , but when you get into the high schools , um , I mean you can talk to the teachers and all that , but as far as really completing as far as the curriculum goes --
Mhm .
-- it 's a lot harder --
Right .
-- um , because they 've got a lot more to deal with because they 're dealing with , um , -- they 're getting ki - kids prepped for college --
Mhm .
-- you know , and if you read a certain book , then what they 're gearing towards is if you are reading this book now and if you go to college , more than likely you 'll end up reading it again .
