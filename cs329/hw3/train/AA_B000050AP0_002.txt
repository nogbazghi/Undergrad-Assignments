They say the filter will last 3 months , but it only lasts about 2-3 weeks .
I use this humidifier in my dry NYC apartment , and it definitely works well .
It 's nice and quiet too , but I have spent WAY too much money on these filters ! !
And I clean the tank MORE often than recommended , and flip the filter every day as recommended !
Why should you go broke just to have a bit of humidity ! ? BUY SOMETHING ELSE !
