The US military is putting a positive spin on the demonstrations in Najaf ( which the BBC says involved hundreds of thousands and the Pentagon says was 5,000 to 7,000 ) marking the 4th anniversary of the fall of Baghdad .
Spokesmodel Rear Admiral Mark Fox said , âThat is their right in the new Iraq .
And , itâs only fair , however , to note that they exercise that right because coalition forces liberated them from a tyrannical , barbaric regime that would never have permitted such freedom of expression .â 
Oh , I think Saddam would nât have objected too strongly to a protest against American occupation of Iraq .
In Baghdad , the anniversary of the advent of freedom , liberty and democracy was celebrated with a curfew and a complete ban on motor vehicle traffic .
Today George Bush re-visited a section of the border with Mexico in Arizona which he visited last year , explaining , â We have come back to this spot because itâs where I was the last time .â 
At the end of the photo op he answered just one question :
Q What most impresses you , Mr. President ?
THE PRESIDENT : The hard work being done .
Later he gave a speech .
âThe Border Patrol is really an important agency .
I know some people are wondering whether or not it makes sense to join the Border Patrol .â 
I will not leave you in suspense : he does in fact think it makes sense to join the Border Patrol .
He went to the border to promote immigration reform , pardon me , comprehensive immigration reform , the issue he thinks will restore his effectiveness as president .
He said , â I hope by now the American people understand the need for comprehensive immigration reform is a clear need .â 
If they donât understand that the need is a clear need does nât it pretty much by definition mean that the need is not a clear need ?
Illegal immigration , he said , is a problem .
It âputs pressure on public schools and the hospitals ,â  he said , and putting pressure on public schools and the hospitals is a job that Americans are actually willing to do ( George is , anyway ) .
Furthermore , he continued , âIt drains the state and local budgets .
I was talking to the governor about how it strained the budgets .â 
Which is it George ?
Drains or strains ?
Or... ohmigod , could it be both ?
The rest of this speech was the same old boiler plate , which drained and indeed strained my patience , so how âbout we just skip it and see what Laura was up to today ?
Or maybe not .
