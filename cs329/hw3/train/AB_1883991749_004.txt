I am the stepfather of three kids , and I read this book at the advice of my wife when we were having trouble with my kids and her kids ... and the relationship between them ... and reading Cohn 's book really helped me understand some of the things that were going on with them and how I should react to them .
Reading it helped me figure things out that I never would have if I had n't .
Definately a must-read for all stepfamilies .
