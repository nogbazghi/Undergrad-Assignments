It 's a chicken-and-egg question : Which comes first , happiness
or success ?
A study in Psychological Bulletin , published by the American Psychological Association ,
suggests that a happy outlook may be more likely to
be the spark that engenders success rather than the other
way around .
The study , whose lead author was Sonja Lyubomirsky ,
a professor of psychology at the University of California , Riverside ,
examined links between success , a positive outlook and happiness in
more than 275,000 people .
Moral of the story : The pursuit of happiness may really pay
off .
