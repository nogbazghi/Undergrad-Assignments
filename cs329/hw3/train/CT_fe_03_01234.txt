That 's neat .
What did -- what did you do at the community college ?
I taught mathematics .
Oh , okay .
Wow , so you 're a numbers person then ?
Sometimes .
Sometimes .
If I do n't have to add or subtract , multiply or divide in front of the classroom --
Uh-huh .
-- I 'm fine .
Once I get in front of the classroom I ca n't do that .
Oh , really ?
I have many students that can testify to that .
So , you 're actually a professor in the -- in the college ?
Yeah .
Oh , neat .
Yeah .
That was only for like eight years .
Uh-huh .
Um , because before that I had to get my degree .
Uh-huh .
But I tutored maths , um --
And you probably would have tutored somebody like me , because I 'm not good in math .
That 's the fun of it .
[inaudible ] I bet .
I enjoy that part .
Yeah .
Well , that 's definitely my weakest subject , so .
It used to be mine .
Really ?
Yeah .
Neat .
You just kept -- kept working at it ?
Well , for awhile I just abandoned every -- every hope of ever getting a degree --
Uh-huh .
-- and then I guess through the course of finding out that if you do n't have a degree you ca n't do anything , I finally said , " Okay , I 'm going to go back and do it " .
Uh-huh .
And when I put the energy into it and went and sought help from people who could help me and stuff like that instead of like giving up , then I was , um , able to make it through it .
Uh-huh .
But um , I 'm not a math whiz or anything like that .
Do n't think that .
Really ?
Because I studied for eight or -- eight or nine hours every day --
Oh , wow .
-- to get the stuff .
That 's pretty intense , I do n't know if I could commit myself to -- to math like that , that 's great .
[inaudible ] neat .
Um --
So , you have two room mates named Kathy ?
Yeah .
Neat .
Tha - that 's cool .
Well , so do you have any other , um , ideas on affirmative action ?
Um , I was trying to think of it , um -- what -- I wonder if in affirmative action would be more important in a bigger corporation .
You know what I mean ?
Yeah .
Um , thinking of a smaller run business may not , um , need -- need it as much possibly unless , um , I do n't know -- like , I think a family run business is -- like everybody in the family does it --
Mhm .
-- or almost everybody in the family does it , but larger corporation - -- larger corporations that have , um , businesses in different cities and --
-- all that kind of stuff , I 'm just thinking that they may need it .
It really -- may be really important for businesses like that .
