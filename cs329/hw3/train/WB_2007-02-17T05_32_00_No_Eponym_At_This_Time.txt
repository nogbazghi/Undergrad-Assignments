This is just one of those profit margin things .
See , the news ca n't make a ton of money selling just to Tennesseans , so the most profitable "news " is that which has the largest market , national news .
This means , over time , that the quality and amount of State news , vital for electing better State legislators , is permanently undermined .
For example , in poor , backwards New York State , there are two or three shows , mostly on PBS on the mornings in the weekend , that deal with Albany politics , and another couple one can catch dealing with Trenton .
How often do individual legislators even get mentioned ?
One way to skip around this is to create massive state legislatures .
1,000 in California would mean one would need to craft whole new methods of creating bills like the Budget , but would also mean that each Rep would have 33,000 constituents .
Maybe only 15K could vote , and only have of them do vote , And even though 3,501 people is still a lot to meet , I 'd like to see Californians do it .
I 'm not sure it would work anywhere if one insisted that this would be a new , third chamber .
Even if one agreed in advance that the new deliberators received no money , had no power , had no great debating hall built for them , and instead just got a website ...
