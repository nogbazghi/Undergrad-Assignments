Die Hard ?
Oh yeah .
I watched all those .
Yeah , the ones that I do n't like to watch in , you know -- is , ah , horror movies .
Horror .
Yeah , I --
Yeah , I do n't like those .
-- I like some if they 're not too scary .
But if they 're too scary --
Mhm .
-- I just close my eyes the whole time , so it 's no point in watching it .
Yeah .
Because I 'm a baby , I ca n't -- it would--
Yeah , I do n't like it either .
I would n't be able to sleep if I watch them .
Oh , same here .
Yeah .
Yeah , and then the most gory[ ? ]
movie that -- I do n't -- I would never want to watch again --
What ?
-- is , ah , Casino .
Oh , yeah they killed everyone .
Have you seen that ?
Yeah , and the way they killed was so brutal that --
Yeah .
-- you know , I watched it on -- on , um , video --
Uh-huh .
-- but yeah , theatre would have been pretty bad I think for me .
Oh , I 'm sure .
Yeah .
Yeah .
I felt like it -- like , I remember a couple of years ago when these movies came out , I watched about three movies all at the same time that were all like the same kind of movie --
Mhm .
Snatch , Blow and Traffic .
Oh --
You know , those --
-- that 's a long time ago , huh ?
Yeah , but --
Yeah .
-- all three of those movies came out around the same time and Blow , Snatch --
Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
-- and Traffic , they all seemed like the same movie over and over again .
Lots of drugs , lots of people dying or at least , you know , getting shot --
Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
-- it seemed like all the same movie .
But I remember I saw all three of those movies in like a span of two weeks and then --
You did , huh ?
-- I could - -- and I could n't remember which movie happened to w- -- you know , what happened in which movie because they all just blended together .
Uh-huh .
You know , at the theatre you can really get into the story and , you know , [several inaudible words ] video too huh , even i- -- it -- even if it 's a smaller screen --
But sometimes with videos , like you can talk and you can do other things so --
Mhm .
-- maybe you 're not so attached to it .
Yeah .
Yeah --
I think the best movie ever on big screen was --
Uh-huh .
-- ah was Mi- -- ah , Mission Impossible .
Oh !
I loved that on the big screen .
That was good , huh ?
