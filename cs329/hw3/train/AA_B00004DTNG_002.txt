Earlier reviews complained about difficulty in finding a button for mulching .
I guess they were right ; I could n't find one .
The instructions just say the leaves will be mulched as they go through the impeller .
After vacuuming a bunch of leaves and dumping them into a recycle bin , I could n't really see any evidence of mulching .
The blower and vacuum work very well , however .
Do n't make the mistake of trying to vacuum leaves from loose dirt ; you 'll suck up a lot of dirt .
Blow the leaves into a pile and then vacuum them .
Still , I like this tool .
It 's much quieter and easier to use than my gas blower .
