This book is OK , but not one that I would actually recommend .
It 's really simplistic and sometimes condescending .
It 's one of a series of "your pregnancy " books , and I really think that the authors took a basic "your pregnancy " book and slipped in a few bits on " after 35 ."
There are paragraphs that are duplicated almost word for word , for example .
The whole book really lacks substance .
Also , the authors write just about every paragraph in terms of the expecting " couple " which might be a given for some people , but I 'm not a " couple , " so it was a bit frustrating for me .
I thought it might be more progressive , since there 's a chapter on single motherhood , but again , this chapter seemed to be just stuck in .
There was n't a lot of continuity .
Finally , there are the "time saving " tips that are just odd .
I felt like I was reading Good Housekeeping from 1955 .
The tips really have almost nothing to do with pregnancy .
I felt like they were filler .
Hopefully , there are better books out there . . .
