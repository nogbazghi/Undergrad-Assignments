Although my BV2500 has developed the major problem cited in many reviews ,it took more than 10 years of high volume leaf vacuuming before it failed .
Had 1/2 acre with many trees ( 60 plus ) now have 1/3 acre with several .
It did as good a job as any homeowner line of tools could be expected to .
No tears in the shoulder bag although 99 % of the time I use the leaf collection system and no noticable impeller wear ( of course I did n't try to vacuum any items that it was n't intended for ( rocks large twigs etc. ) , Silly old me , I try to use a tool for what it is intended ( leaves ) .
Will I buy another ?
You bet I just ordered one today , and if it only lasts several years I 'm still way ahead , at $ 54.00 Amazon ) no tax and free delivery .
Use it for what it is and take care of it as you would all your other tools .
