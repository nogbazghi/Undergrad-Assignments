As he so fearsomely threatened , Tony Blair has released hard evidence that the British sailors were seized within Iraqi waters ( actually , floating on top of Iraqi waters , one would assume ) .
Here is that hard evidence : 29 degrees 50.36 minutes north , 048 degrees 43.08 minutes east .
Pretty much conclusive , huh ?
Title of a Bush speech : âPresident Bush Discusses Economy , War on Terror During Remarks to the National Cattlemenâs Beef Association .â 
âItâs good to be with fellow conservationists ,â  he told the ranchers .
â[ T]hereâs a fundamental debate in Washington , when you really get down to it , â  he told them , âand the debate is who best to spend your money .
And I believe a cattleman can spend their money better than the government can .â 
So thereâs a fundamental debate in Washington over whether cattlemen can spend money better than the government .
This was in fact a point of division between Madison and Hamilton in the Federalist Papers ( Madison , not surprisingly , said it was the cattlemen ) .
â I say the tax cuts work .
Since we enacted major tax reform in 2003 , in response to recession and a terrorist attack , this economy of ours has created more than 7 million jobsâ .
Tax cuts were a response to 9/11 ?
â When Iâm talking to [foreign ] leaders and theyâve got an issue with American beef , itâs on the agenda .
I say , if you want to get the attention of the American people in a positive way , you open up your markets to U.S. beef .â 
Also , âEvery time we break down a barrier to trade , it makes it more likely somebody whoâs raising a cow will have an opportunity to sell that cow into a better market .â 
Not better for the cow , mind you .
He did not say whether the Iraqis have gotten the attention of the American people in a positive way by opening up their markets to US beef , but he did say â  and in this case his inability to correctly use prepositions is accidentally revealing â  âAnd then they elected a government underneath that constitution .â 
Heâs also not good with verb forms , saying twice that âThe lesson of September the 11th must not be forgot .â 
Or possibly heâs confusing the lesson of September 11 with old acquaintance and auld lang syne .
The Iraqi people , he says , âsee positive changes .â 
In proof of this , he quoted ... wait for it ... âtwo Iraqi bloggers -- they have bloggers in Baghdad , just like weâve got here â .
He did nât mean Riverbend , who has nât posted in more than a month .
Actually , I donât know who he meant , since the alleged quote he gave from these alleged Iraqi alleged bloggers about how everything is so much better now , is nowhere to be found on the web , according to alleged Google .
[Update : Itâs evidently the blog Iraq the Model ( which I donât know , although its blogroll is entirely right-wing and , while long , fails to include Juan Cole or Riverbend ) , but the quotes he used seem to be from a Wall Street Journal op-ed by the two rather than the blog .
Sheryl Gay Stolberg of the NYT points out that the bloggers met Bush in the White House in 2004 .]
âIf the House bill becomes law , our enemies in Iraq would simply have to mark their calendars .â 
And theyâd probably mark them with smiley faces .
SMILEY FACES !
