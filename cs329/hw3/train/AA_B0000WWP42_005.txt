I bought this humidifier when i had my baby .
It gets moldy , slimy and you have to clean it out after every other use .
I also find that it emits a horrible odor as well like mildew if you do not change the water in the bottom tray too often .
Dont feel that it is great to have my child breathing this in .
GET SOMETHING ELSE.
