I use this Vacuum for my auto detailing company .
It is compact , powerful , easy to clean out and comes with a lot of useful attachements .
The hose is flexible and well made .
I will br buying more of these .
: ::Edit : : :
Unit breaks faster than my $ 70 vacuums from home depot , I have two of these and both are busted .
The case , which is made of metal and feels very solid has clips that break after a while and wo n't hold the top on .
Also , if you step on the hose , it bends permanently and does n't work as well and clogs after that .
