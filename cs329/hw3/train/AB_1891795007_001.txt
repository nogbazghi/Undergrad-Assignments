We sure are sorry to write a less than thrilled review for a book that looked and sounded so good .
Our 3-year old daughter was really looking forward to receiving this book and , possibly , taking it to share with her class for "desert " week .
We love roadrunners ; she 's had a stuffed one from a trip to AZ since she was less than a year old .
This book was so disappointing .
The photos are scary on a majority of pages : boldly colored , large , wide-open mouthed roadrunners with bugged eyes chasing wildly after bugs and lizards .
The story itself is about roadrunners often settling for non-lizard meals , but craving and madly pursuing lizards to eat .
Theme aside , the story itself could track so much better from page spread to page spread .
The authors tried to do too much .
The theme of roadrunners hotly pursuing frightened lizards and bugs to eat is interrupted with pages here and there about the physical description and vocalizations of roadrunners .
The result is a badly disjointed story line .
Even the " chorus " does not flow with rhymes on preceding or subsequent page spreads .
We did like the rhymes in the book , but they are almost entirely overshadowed by the poor flow of the story and the frightening pictures .
The book is absolutely not worth purchasing for the rhymes alone ( they are not that consisent or good ) .
The book could be so much better if it either stuck only to the theme of "what roadrunners eat " OR ( in our opinion a better choice ) " all about roadrunners " .
