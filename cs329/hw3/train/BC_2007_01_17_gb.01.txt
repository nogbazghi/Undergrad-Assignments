Wait , wait , wait .
Let me -- let me show this guy who I describe as the Amish guy from last night .
Watch this .
... can be mean to me , mean as you want to be .
Just say anything that you like .
You can be nasty and catty and cruel and unusual .
Twist my nose with your fingers , trip me as I carry liquid .
OK .
Stop .
Stop .
That guy really thinks he` s going to be on " American Idol " ?
Yes
That` s a plant .
And he had -- and he sang something about spitting in his mouth , which was , like , totally unnecessary .
It was horrible .
Change the lyrics .
Come on .
But wait .
But wait .
Do you really think that that` s just somebody at home going , " I could get on the" -- you know , it` s somebody looking for their 15 minutes of fame .
Yes .
I think that some people do show up there just to be on camera and go over the top to do it .
But I mean , you really have to be crazy enough to go on there and do that .
You know ?
Yes .
They`ve already gone through the producers and the executive producer to get to the judges .
OK .
Now Diana Ross announced yesterday on David Letterman that she` s going to be ...
Well ...
I mean , she` s a little nuts , though , do n` t you think ?
She` s going to be a mentor .
But I do n` t know .
It` s Diana Ross .
Who cares ?
She` s amazing .
She` s nuts .
I mean , you know ?
I do n` t know her personally , so I` m not going to -- I` m not going to speak .
Thanks , Glenn .
I made you uncomfortable from start to finish , have n` t I ?
You could n` t make me uncomfortable if you tried .
Really ?
No.
Come next week .
I`ll try a little harder .
But I actually , you know , I think that that` s really cool that Diana Ross is going to be a mentor .
I think it` s going to be really intimidating for the idols , but it will also prepare them to go in front of , you know , their other celebrity guests or judges that they`re going to have .
All right .
Kim , thanks .
Up next , " The Real Story " on both Barack Obama and the falling oil prices .
Have you noticed that ?
Coming up next .
Welcome to " The Real Story . "
Have you ever noticed how the people who are vilified when things go wrong usually are not celebrated when those same things go right ?
For example , do you have any idea what the name of the CIA director is right now ? Yes , I ca n` t really remember , either .
You know why ?
Because there has n` t been a terrorist attack in about five years .
But trust me , if it happens , oh , you`ll know his name very , very well , because he` s going to be torn apart by every politician and columnist looking for a scapegoat .
Now , I make that point because it` s exactly what` s happening right now with President Bush and oil prices .
Last summer , oh , in the heat of the election , gas was $ 3 a gallon , and everybody was saying , " George Bush is in bed with the oil companies , giving special favors to his Texas oil buddies , " and then there was that big uproar over the huge profits that the oil companies were making .
How can they live with themselves , making so much money over our backs when we ca n` t even afford gas for our cars ?
