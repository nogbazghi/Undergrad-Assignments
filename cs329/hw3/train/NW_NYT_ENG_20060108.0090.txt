What a lovely difference a few years can
make .
Not so long ago , the Boeing Co. 's commercial aircraft division seemed
on the ropes .
Orders were falling .
The once-dominant builder of
airliners had been overtaken by its European rival , Airbus Industrie .
Boeing has since seen a turnaround , and its final report for
2005 shows how big the turnaround was .
It sold 1,002
airliners -- an all-time record , 125 percent higher than both
Boeing and mcDonnell Douglas sold in 1988 , the previous highwater
mark for the now-merged companies .
In 2005 , Airbus sold a little more than 700 planes .
Boeing also set single-year sales records for three jets , the 737 ,
777 and the new 787 Dreamliner .
It even revived the
fortunes of its 747 line by announcing plans for a
modernized version of the old warhorse .
For a while there , it looked as if Boeing was doomed
to second place .
The company 's performance has put any fatalism
about its future thoroughly to rest .
