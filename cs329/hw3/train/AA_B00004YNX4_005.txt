Agreed - this mixer has got a TON of power ! ! !
I actually had to purchase a high-walled mixing bowl to go with this mixer .
It splatters liquids all over the place with a regular bowl .
However , now that I have the high-walled bowl , I find it to be a very good mixer that gets the job done .
I love the new design of the beaters ( no center post ) - its makes it immensely easier to clean and less waste !
