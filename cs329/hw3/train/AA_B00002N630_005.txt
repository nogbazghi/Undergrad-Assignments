My mother has been cleaning houses ( including LOTS of vacuuming ) for years .
She used a model identical to this one for almost 15 years ( HEAVY use ) and she cried the day it died .
I began a frantic search for a replacement immediately .
Finally found one here and was thrilled .
Received the product quickly and was very excited to discover that the quality was the same as my mother 's previous Eureka .
Great product ! !
