My son picked up " Everyday Math for Dummies " at the library .
He saw the word " Math " and had to have it .
Once he saw that it contained more words than numbers , however , he put it down .
As I flipped through it I decided I would bring it home anyway , if only for the chapter on balancing your checkbook , a task I have always struggled to master .
This is actually a very good book , providing an introduction to the Math that you wish that they would teach you in school - like how to balance a checkbook , figure out compound interest ( OK - I think they taught that one in school but it had little real-world applicability at that point ) , and how to understand stock values and mortgage rates .
And for those of you who really want to understand what they wanted to teach you in Algebra and Trig , it provides sections on that as well ( I 'll admit I skipped over those ) .
I read the reviews on Amazon and some mentioned that it was n't simple enough .
I can understand that .
You do need some understanding of basic math to get this book - adding , subtraction , multiplication , division , and percentages are all taken for granted here .
Still , it was very interesting and helped explain some topics that had eluded me for years .
