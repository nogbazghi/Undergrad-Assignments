Mark Miller has been covering the story for " Newsweek" .
He joins me now .
Mark , in this article that I read from " Newsweek" , you say that he uses the language of a wife abuser , or a spouse abuser .
What does that mean exactly ?
MARK MILLER , " NEWSWEEK" : Right .
It means that he blames all of his troubles on Nicole .
She` s changed .
She` s not a good person anymore .
She` s a bad mother .
She` s flinging her sexual dalliances in his face .
She` s -- she` s doing things that he disapproves of and pushing all his buttons , and he just ca n` t take it anymore .
And he` s going to , you know , have to teach her a lesson .
All right .
What else is in this -- this chapter ?
When you read it , what did your gut say ?
Well , you know , like everyone I think I wondered what did it actually say , and when I got it , you know , I read it .
And I have to say that , you know , if he wrote it or the ghostwriter wrote it , it` s a fairly convincing job , because it` s written as a first person narrative , very straightforwardly .
But it` s really that tone , that tone of , you know , Nicole , she was , as he calls her , the enemy at one point .
And he just -- he ca n` t take it anymore .
He` s going to go over to Bundy` s , and he` s driving over there with a friend , which is a man he calls Charlie , which really is the major departure from the evidence in the case .
And he` s putting on the cap and the gloves , which he keeps in the Bronco to have when it gets cold on the golf course .
And he also has a knife which he actually calls a very nice knife , which he has to have because there are crazy people in L.A. , and you never know when you need a knife .
So it` s the tone and then it` s those details that make it seem quite convincing , even though he still says it` s not true , and he has nothing to confess to .
Well , I will tell you , I mean , I ca n` t believe I` m playing devil` s advocate and that is really what I` m playing here .
You should .
Let me play devil` s advocate .
I` m just -- I` m reading a Vince Flynn novel right now .
That seems pretty real .
Right .
And I agree .
The facts as he lays them out were things that were fairly well known .
Again , I think what really sends it over the top is the tone of the writing , because you can see O.J. and hear him as he works himself up into greater levels of rage .
And it` s when , you know , he encounters Ron Goldman .
He` s convinced , you know , that he` s going to have a sexual liaison with Nicole , and that` s why Ron Goldman is there , even though Ron keeps denying it .
He just wants to return some glasses .
And you know , one of the more chilling moments is when the dog , Kato , bizarrely named Kato , comes out of the condo .
The dog , in O.J.` s view , is overly friendly to Ron and he wags his tail at him , and that kind of seals it for Ron , because O.J. thinks he` s been here before .
