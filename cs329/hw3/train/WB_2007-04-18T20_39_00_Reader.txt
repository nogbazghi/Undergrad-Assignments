1 . Will that Japanese toilet with the remote control wipe my butt ?
If not , I ai n't interested .
( What ELSE could the remote be for ? )
2. Exploding toilets give new meaning to the term "my ass is on fire " .
3. Making abortion illegal will almost certainly result in some children being left behind .
4 . I am really surprised that Bush , in reacting to the Supreme Court decision on abortions , was not able to work " a loving God " into it somehow .
