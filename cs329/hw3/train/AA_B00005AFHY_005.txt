This hose is exactly what I was looking for .
Some of the other reviewers perhaps were not using this hose for it primary intended use :
If you look nearer towards the top of this page , you 'll see a section titled : " Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought . "
Looking here , you 'll really see what this hose is for : sanding !
So , just to be clear , this hose is really not meant for all-around general vacuuming jobs , and for this purpose , I think you 'd be disappointed .
For me , it works wonderfully with my Bosch 1/4 sheet sander .
Basically , the hose is very lightweight and flexible .
I tried using a regular shop-vac hose along with some adapters , but there was probably one foot of fittings hanging off the end of my sander , and it could only be held with two hands .
It was about as easy as sanding with something as big and heavy as a circular saw .
With this hose , I can pick the sander up with one hand , and maneuver it around effortlessly .
Sanding is light and controlled , and most of all - clean .
And for fine sanding , I would also recommend picking up a disposable drywall bag for your shop-vac too - it will totally eliminate dust clouds coming out of your shop-vac.

FYI - this hose should fit most ShopVac brand vacs , but will NOT fit " Ridgid " brand vacs .
