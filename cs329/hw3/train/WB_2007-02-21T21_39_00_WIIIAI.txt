One problem Hillary Clinton has with refusing to say that her Iraq war vote was wrong is that it implies she thinks it was right .
Since it clearly was nât that , she needs some other adjective .
Today she chose one : she was nât wrong , she was ... wait for it ... sincere .
âMy vote was a sincere vote based on the facts and assurances that I had at the time .â 
As the patron saint of this blog said , once you can fake sincerity , you âve got it made .
Hillary , of course , does not have it made .
She also said â I have taken responsibility for my vote .â 
Isnât that nice of her ? Like if she hadnât gone out of her way to take responsibility , whatever that means , she would nât actually be responsible for her vote .
Speaking of responsibility , and indeed speaking of faking sincerity , Tony Blair has no doubt that his decision to join the invasion of Iraq had nothing to do with any subsequent difficulties in that country : âThe reason it is tough in Iraq and is difficult is because terrorists are making it difficult .
... We did not cause the terrorism , the terrorists caused the terrorism ,â  adding , â We will beat them when we realise itâs not our fault that theyâre doing this .
... We will win if we donât apologise for our values .â 
Yes , but do you take responsibility for your values ?
Actually , Iâm a little unclear on how not apologizing is relating to the capacity to win a military engagement .
Although the British will be pulling some troops out of Basra , they will be deploying Prince Harry to Iraq .
And the Japanese are deploying Prince Pickles .
A Defense Agency official explains : âPrince Pickles is our image character because heâs very endearing , which is what Japanâs military stands for .â 
Among other things .
