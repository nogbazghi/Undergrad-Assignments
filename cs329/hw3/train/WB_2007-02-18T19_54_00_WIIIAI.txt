Condi is in the Middle East for a summit with Olmert and Abbas .
She is nât really expecting much in the way of accomplishments , or indeed , physical coordination : â I am not going to ask anyone to run when we really need to walk for a while , because , as I said , I think if we ask everybody to run somebody is going to fall down .â 
Really , if they both show up , that âs good enough for Condi : â Nobody is at the point of talking about a deal ... What I would consider a success tomorrow is that we have gotten started .â 
That woman is the guru of low achievers everywhere .
Following her example , if I get out of bed tomorrow , I will consider it a success .
If I put my pants on , it will be a triumph .
She met with Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , which may or not have produced any tangible results , and who cares because Condi & Tzipi meetings always produce such fabulous photos :
There were more French troops fighting for American independence at Yorktown than American troops , did you know that ?
I did nât know that .
John McCain gave a speech promoting abstinence to a bunch of South Carolina teenagers at a rally sponsored by one of those religious anti-abortion â  pregnancy centers .â 
In yesterdayâs story announcing the rally , the AP chose to use this 3-month old picture , presumably because McCain seems to be trying to hold up his pants .
Which is surprisingly immature of the AP , and I wish Iâd thought of it first .
Iâm frustrated that the only coverage of the speech Iâve found , from the AP , is sketchy but tantalizing .
So we know he told the teenagers , âSometimes Iâve made the wrong choice , â  and he seems to have compared high school peer pressure to his experiences at the Hanoi Hilton , where the North Vietnamese âwanted to make us do things that we otherwise would nât do . â 
More , dammit , we want more !
