Football ?
Or football .
It seems like those are the two biggies .
Baseball is getting pushed out , but , um ...
L- look at these poor -- I mean , we 're sending young people home in body bags .
They could be -- they could feed a third world country --
Country .
-- on their income .
Thank you !
You know --
Thank you !
-- they really could .
I -- I tell --
I -- I think that 's pretty ridiculous .
Maybe they should have a service obligation to -- back to the community .
Mhm .
They -- they say they , um , with all these commercials where they go in and they read to the schools and they donate money , but they -- they do n't even need half of those --
But is it enough ?
Is it enough , you know ?
It 's -- it 's -- it 's not enough .
