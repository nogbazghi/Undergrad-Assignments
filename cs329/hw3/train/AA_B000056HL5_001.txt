If I could give ZERO stars I without a doubt would !
DO NOT BUY this product .
I bought this humidifer for my baby with a cold and he spent 5 days in the hospital and is now home on oxygen because he has chemical pnuemonia ! !
There was so much " WHIT DUST " using this for the first time that you could not see my babies crib ! !
We followed instructions carefully and were using bottled distilled water .
We went to the store we purchased it , got a new one and did an experiment in our basement-- THE SAME THING HAPPEND !
This happend 7 weeks ago and it has been a night mare ...my perfectly healthy baby has undergone CT SCANs , X-rays , bronchioscopes needing general anesthesia , inhalers , prednisone , lasix---- all to try to make him better .
Pulmonologist are stumped at what to do .
THIS IS A SCARY PRODUCT----I CALLED THE -1800 number on the box and the women says they will not recall a product over a phone call ! ! ! SCARY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
