Okay , this one read like a playground seesaw .
Sometimes it was really good .
The new feats and prestige classes were amazing .
But sometimes it was just plain bad .
Jander Sunstar is listed as Chaotic Evil , though his description in his novel and short stories , as well as the description in this book , show him as noble and self-sacrificing .
He 's also missing MANY feats .
To top this off , the adventure ideas in the book are n't really very imaginative .
Overall , the book is worth the money for the feats and prestige classes , alone .
Just do n't expect much more .
