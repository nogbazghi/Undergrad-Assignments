Review by Jill Williamson
Hayden and Ewan recently moved to rural Missouri .
Their mother recently passed away , and they are grieving her loss and the loss of their old home .
Hayden has been assigned the job of clearing the briar patch , and Hayden , for fun , has been clearing it by cutting tunnels into it .
His brother Ewan offers to help one day .
As they are working , four ravens approach carrying something .
The birds drop their cargo in the briar patch and vanish .
Hayden and Ewan discover four tubes holding scrolls .
Each reads the same : You have been chosen for a life of great purpose .
Adventure awaits you in the hidden lands .
The boys search for the birds and discover a stone arch with strange carvings on it .
An arch that is a portal to another world .
The Book of Names is a clever , intriguing story .
Briggs does a wonderful job of crafting his storyworld .
His characters are real , with faults and fears .
My favorite character is Creed and his magical sword that will not allow him to tell a lie .
Briggs ' story is filled with wonderful parallels that really get you thinking about life .
This book is a great choice for fantasy lovers .
I ca n't wait for the sequel .
