My original vacuum had a hepa filter on it that needing replacing and apparently the manufacturer no longer made them .
I ordered this vacuum because all it needed was a bag .
I am very pleased with it .
It is fairly quiet for a vacuum cleaner , my old model used to scream like a banshee , and it does n't have a bunch of hoses wrapped around it constantly coming loose like my old model .
It cleans the carpet just as well as the old model .
If you just need to vacuum the floor , this model is great .
