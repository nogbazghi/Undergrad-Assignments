After much on-line research , I purchased this machine .
It is amazing .
The first time I used it , the Bissell picked up so much dirt that you would have sworn my carpet had never been vacuumed before !
It left my carpets looking great .
However , I could n't give it five stars because on my bare floor , it just blew the dirt around , so do n't buy this machine if you have lots of bare floors .
