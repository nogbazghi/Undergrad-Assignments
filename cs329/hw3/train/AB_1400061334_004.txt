Though not as good a book as the author 's " Imperial Grunts " this sequel is a very well-done work .
As in the previous book , Kaplan visits U.S. military outposts , large and small , around the world , describing the quiet and usually effective efforts our elite troops are executing to keep peace and prepare , if necessary , for war .
As another reviewer noted , this is primarily a military travelogue and Kaplan , who I believe is one of the premier travel writers of this or any other time , winnows out the fascinating and the exotic as he writes about the various U.S. posts and the troops who man them .
Some of the chapters are very compelling , such as the one describing the "pilots " of the unmanned Predators , the one describing the B-2 bomber pilots , the submarine crews , the green berets and so on .
All in all , a fine account of today 's military culture and the many ways we are waging -- overtly and covertly -- the Global War on Terrorism and wars to come .
