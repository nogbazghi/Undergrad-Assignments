I was assigned this book for school and it was probably one of the most boring books I 've ever read .
The opening is too boring to grab at your attention , and by the time it gets exciting , it 's too late and your interest is gone .
What 's strange about this book is , at different points , the book was very interesting and informative .
The only problem is that it had periods of being very interesting , and then really , really boring .
The bad sort of outweighs the good .
I recommend to you ... do something useful with your time instead of wasting it on this book .
