Dragon Mountain has to be one of the BEST AD&D adventures ever to be made , together with Temple of Elemental Evil , Tomb of Horrors , Castle Greyhawk , and Desert of Desolation !
The adventure is divided into three parts , with each making use of its own respective booklet and set of maps .
It deals with a whole mountain that used to be the home to clans of dwarves , but has now fallen under the control/command of an ancient , powerful and very evil Red Dragon and his kobold armies .
The kobolds are divided into clans , with their own politics , alliances , and rivalries .
Their vast network of spies , limitless intrigue , extensive use of traps and poison , and assortment of resident monsters , make up for a formidable adversary indeed , that will surely win you over if a good challenge is what you are looking for !
There seems to be no end to adventure whether inside or outside Dragon Mountain .<br>As
a result , I have had endless hours of gaming enjoyment playing on material presented within the pages of this super-adventure !<br> In
short , if you enjoy a good dungeon crawl that also requires a lot of planning beforehand , as well as getting involved in the world of clan politics and their web of intrigue and deceit , try and get your hands on a copy of Dragon Mountain .
You 'll never see kobolds in the same light ever again !
Trust me !
