the picture shown for this product does not reflect what you receive . the filter was in a plastic bag that was wrapped in newspaper then placed in a shipping plastic bag .
I received the item in the mail and it was crushed .
The company selling this product is fortunate that people like myself are too lazy to repackage and return the item .
It 's such a hassle .
I 'll never purchase from this company again .
