I have to agree with the negative reviews .
I previously had an extrusion type pasta maker and thought that this was the way to go for making pasta .
So , when I purchased my Kitchen Aid , I purchased the pasta maker attachment as well .
I was strongly disappointed .
The taste of the homemade noodles was not worth the damage to the mixer .
The mixer became very hot , and the whole process took longer than I thought it should have .
This resulted in some damage to my mixer - the next day when I turned it on , the motor was making grinding noises .
I did everything according to the instructions when I used the pasta maker , and used the " Basic Egg Noodle " recipe out of the Kitchen Aid booklet .
If you love you mixer , do n't buy this attachment .
I think that using the pasta maker over time could possibly result in serious damage to your mixer .
Also , I think that the pasta maker plates are poorly designed .
The openings for the noodles to extrude through are very small , thus increasing the process time and the strain on the mixer .
