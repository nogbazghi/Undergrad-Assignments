A wonderful second edition in this series of three books .
D. Woolley easily wraps the fictional characters in with the real historical figures , so much so that you sometimes forget that you are reading a fictional book .
This edition continues to follow Aaron , the Blacksmith 's son , and Rebekah , the Potter 's daughter , and their love .
Aaron heals with Nephi 's family the whole time still believing that Rebekah has died .
We are introduced to the people of Fort Lakhish , who add mystery and adventure to the story .
We , also , see Zoram , an employee of Laban , and Elizabeth , the Blacksmith 's daughter grow closer .
While Daniel , the Blacksmith 's second son and guard to Laban , move farther from his family and into the clutches of Laban 's evil .
Hopefully D. Woolley can keep up the suspence in the third edition .
