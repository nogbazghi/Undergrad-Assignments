I bought this for a car vac.
I 've only used it once so far , but it worked so much better than every other carvac i 've ever used .
Pros : small ; powerful ; easy to empty ; sturdy build
Cons : gets a little hot when in use for a while ( however , it was hot in the garage , so i 'm not sure how much that contributed )
