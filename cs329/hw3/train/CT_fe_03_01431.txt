And I think that the more you think about it , uh , the more you realize that -- that you need to help -- to help us , uh --
Right .
-- in this country , uh --
Mhm .
-- help them , uh , get to school and so forth .
Right .
Uh-huh .
Yes .
I -- I have changed , uh , since nine eleven and -- and I hope that , uh , I 'll continue to --
Oh , yeah .
Mhm .
-- to change more .
I -- I have an -- an -- and I can see that it definitely was for the best .
Yes .
And , uh , I mean , I 've -- you know , I mean , I 've always been a caring person , but I 've --
Yes .
I try to care more --
Yes .
-- than others --
But -- but now it 's --
-- than myself .
-- it 's really , uh , you -- you 've really , uh , been -- been awakened , so to speak , more , uh , even though you did care in the past and --
Mhm .
-- and I have , uh , cared in the past , too , but um , I just never realized until nine eleven that people could , uh , feel so strongly a - against other people , that they would be willing to sacrifice themselves and other people to -- to take down the United States .
Mhm .
Yeah , yeah .
And that -- and we -- we need to maybe show others that we are more caring and we -- and , uh , and we do think of other people .
I know they think that we -- all we care about is oil and --
Right .
Right .

Right .
Uh-huh .
But , uh , that is n't true at all because --
No, that 's definitely not true .

Right .
I -- I definitely believe I agree with that .
I definitely agree with that .
Uh-huh .
Yeah , and , uh , I -- I -- I think , uh , really , al- although we still hearing things in , uh , problems in the school system --
Yes .
-- I think that , uh , it 's gotten better .
Yes , I think --
Yeah --
-- that it has .
Mhm .
I -- I think in -- in Durham , things have gotten better .
Um , I 'd been away for a long time and I decided to come back and I 'm happy , uh , that , uh , things have gotten better in many ways .
I live in a -- a multi racial community and --
Mhm .
