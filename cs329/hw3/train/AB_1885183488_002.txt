This book is really fun , and the more I think about it , the more I like it .
The great thing about this book is that it isnt trying to be inspirational .
It presents some very interesting people , and doesnt try to be more than a little book .
I am going to order a few of new paperbacks .
I know a lot of talented people who changed career directions after 40 .
I know a lot more people who have talent but dont trust it .
I think people contemplating life or career change would find this book interesting .
