-- it 's just -- I do n't know .
I -- I think a lot of the time -- I do n't know if they come up from homes where they really did n't have much and --
They 're kind of over-reacting ?
Yeah .
That could be .
And also they do n't know how to use it .
That 's true .
And how to handle it because they did n't have it .
They do n't do the investing and stuff .
Right .
' Cause I think ... Okay .
This is mean of me .
But I think with like , the NBA , the basketball guys and stuff --
Mhm .
-- a lot of them I do n't think do the hi- -- you know , they do n't get their degrees and stuff .
Mhm .
They go straight in , you know , to basketball , uh , professionally .
Really ?
So , they -- they have no other education .
Oh , that 's too bad !
Yeah .
I mean , I heard -- you know , I 'm sure you 've heard it too , that they just kinda get pushed through school --
Uh-huh .
-- and , uh , they end up graduating when really they s - should n't .

You know ?
They did n't learn it .
Right .
So , you know , I just ... I think the NBA is -- NBA and the baseball are like the worst as far as I 'm concerned .

Right .
And we end up paying for it .
Oh , yeah .
Right .
If -- if we decide to go and watch the game .
Right .
We pay for it , yeah .
So ...
Well , even -- as my husband said , uh , " If you buy anything that 's , um , being advertised in between , on commercials --"
Oh , yes .
Right .
"-- you 're also supporting them too " .
Yeah , that 's true .
You are .
Yeah .
Ah .
But we do n't do that much TV buying .
So ...
Yeah .
I do n't either .
So , that 's a good thing .
Yeah .
Yeah .
So , do you have kids that do sports ?
Um , actually , mine are very little .
They are --
Are they ?
Yeah .
I 've got one that 's almost eight , and a five and a two year old .
Oh , my ! Just got a --
