I was pregnant when I purchased this , so was n't really looking to lose weight .
Something I read about it made me think I could channel the hypnosis for other goals , however--and I was right .
I focused on curing my pregnancy-induced insomnia , improving my confidence at work , in addition to helping me keep my pregnancy weight gain under control .
I fully believe this program helped in all these areas , and look forward to the time my new son allows me to use it again , this time for its intended purpose !
