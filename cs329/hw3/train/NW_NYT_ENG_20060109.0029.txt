Shortly after the Red Sox won the World Series in October
2004 , the Potts family of Milton , Mass .
decided to get
a Great Dane puppy .
On the day of the big
victory parade , they drove to Connecticut and came back with
an 8-week-old toddler who already stood 13 inches high and
weighed 13 pounds .
But what to name him ?
" Great Danes are all named after
the gods , like Zeus or Thor , " says the father in
the family , Richard .
( It 's true .
My cousin 's Great Dane was
named Atlas , whose 15 minutes of fame came after the
Associated Press sent out a photo of him in the
back seat of the family 's Volkswagen Beetle , his head out
one window , his tail out the other . )
No one in the Potts household could agree on a name ,
so Janet Potts , the only female in the family , decided
to exercise a time-honored tradition : The mother would choose the
name .
Rich and Janet have three sons - 15 , 17 ,
and 20 .
In keeping with family tradition , the puppy was also a male .
Janet , a die-hard Red Sox fan , named him after the
"other man " in her life - Damon .
As in Johnny .
This puppy was indeed named after a god - the
God of Center Field .
" Johnny Damon was the spark of
the team , " Janet says with a smile .
" The catalyst , " Rich says .
When Damon was 5 months old , Rich somehow talked Janet into
getting a second puppy .
That was last April , when you
could find Janet on Opening Day in the front row
of the Green Monster seats .
Hopes were high for a
repeat of the unbelievable '04 season .
What to name the second Great Dane ?
Again , Janet stepped in .
" I could n't think of anyone I respected more than Theo
Epstein . "
Theo it was .
" Not to mention that Theo Potts
is a fine , handsome man , just like Theo Epstein , " Janet
adds .
Everything was fine ; the boys were growing like weeds .
( They each
eat 9 cups of dog food a day .
" With a
raw egg mixed in for protein , and a vitamin C , "
Janet says . )
At 15 months , Damon is a strapping 130
pounds , while 10-month-old Theo is only 110 .
When they place
their paws on Janet 's or Rich 's shoulders , the dogs tower
over the adults .
And at 3 feet tall - they
can rest their chins comfortably on the kitchen counter -
each is still growing .
On a recent day , the dogs bound toward the door of
their home , each one wearing a Red Sox scarf .
Their
heads are larger than most microwave ovens , their wagging tails
could give a serious case of whiplash .
Rich 's mantra is ,
" Get down !
Get down ! "
The dogs , sweet as they are ,
have selective hearing .
" I will never have nice furniture , " Janet says as Damon comes
and sits his rump on her lap , his two front
paws on the floor .
Over on the couch , Theo has
made himself similarly comfortable .
When Rich arrives home from work ,
he often finds rugs askew and furniture out of position .
Christmas ornaments recently proved an irresistible temptation to the dogs .
At first , all was well .
Damon was the model only child
- well-behaved , sweet , docile .
Then Theo came along , the typical
youngest : " Spoiled brat , " in Janet 's words .
Damon is definitely Janet 's
dog , a mama 's boy .
Rich likes Theo , the renegade .
( Ironically ,
Damon 's personality seems more like Theo Epstein 's , while doggy Theo
is more like Johnny Damon . )
Aside from some chewed furniture and deck railings that look as
if termites were there , the Potts household was chugging along
happily .
But bad things began to happen .
Theo Epstein left
the Red Sox , shocking the Nation .
Then Johnny Damon bailed
out , trading Fenway Park for the Bronx , his long hair
for a proper Yankee cut .
Friends began calling the Pottses asking if they were going to
change the dogs ' names .
" You jinxed the team , " accused one
neighbor .
After Janet sent out Christmas cards bearing the dogs '
photograph , another friend called .
" Why do n't you get another dog
and name him Manny ?
Maybe he 'll leave the Red Sox ,
too . "
The Pottses will not change the dogs ' names .
" They 'd be in
therapy the rest of their lives , " Janet says .
" Plus , I 'm
hoping Theo will come back to the Sox . "
" He 's gonna come back , " adds Rich .
Meanwhile , they 're trying to train their Theo to act more like
his namesake .
" He 's going to be a nice , gentle , kind
canine , " Janet says .
Still , she ca n't help but laugh when
Theo comes up to her and drops a pair of
socks at her feet .
The dogs also chewed on the
dining set that once belonged to Rich 's grandmother .
" They 're teething , " Rich explains .
" They settle down at age 2 ."
With two Great Danes , the family will never have a Martha
Stewart home .
( Martha has pugs . )
But they 'll never be cold ,
either .
Damon sleeps at the foot of Janet 's and Rich 's
king-sized bed , stretched out full length .
" It 's like a quilt
at the bottom of the bed , " says Rich .
" He 's so warm , " Janet says .
" But you ca n't get up at
night because he 's on your feet . "
It 's apparent that Damon is a one-woman man .
When 17-year-old Greg
kisses his mother goodbye , Damon barks in protest and chases
the boy , "pinching " his backside with his teeth .
" He 's jealous , "
Janet says .
Much as she loves the doggy Damon , Janet is disgusted with
the human one .
" I 've totally written him off , " she says .
" There 's only one Damon in Boston now , and that 's Damon
Potts . "
But what to do about a center fielder for the Red
Sox ?
What about Ichiro ?
" Do n't even go there , " Janet says .
" I am not getting a third Great Dane . "
