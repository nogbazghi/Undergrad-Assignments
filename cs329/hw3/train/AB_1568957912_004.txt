I ORIGINALLY GOT THE BOOK FROM THE LIBRARY .
I FOUND IT TO BE STRAIGHTFORWARD,EASY TO UNDERSTAND.IT WAS IN A FORM THAT CAN EASILY BE UNDERSTOOD BY JUST ABOUT EVERYONE.
I FOUND THE CONCEPTS REASONABLE AND PRETTY EASY TO APPLY .
THE CONCEPTS ARE SIMPLE AND DEFFINATELY DO ABLE.
IT WAS HONEST AND NON-THREATENING.
