Of course , Barbara , the Bush administration has a little credibility problem with this , given the faulty intelligence in the run-up to the war in Iraq .
How are they going to get around that ?
Well , it 's very clear that that is one stumbling block at this point , especially at the State Department , where they are very aware that their , you know , claims of WMD in Iraq did n't prove to be true .
What officials say is this time it is different .
They already do have the evidence in hand .
The only reason they would not make it public , they say , is if it compromised their intelligence-gathering capability , but they are convinced this time that they do have the evidence in hand -- Miles .
Barbara Starr at the Pentagon , thank you very much .
Race to the White House now .
A year away before any primary voting , but they 're campaigning like there 's no tomorrow .
Senator Hillary Clinton campaigning in Iowa , bashing President Bush on Iraq .
Former New York mayor , Rudy Giuliani , still testing the presidential waters , speaking to the New Hampshire Republican party convention .
We look toward the future .
We have to reassert our -- the basic core principles of the Republican Party .
We 've got to be -- you know , we 've got to be about being Republican strong , not Democrat light .
When people tell me , you know , I do n't think America can really face up to its problems , deal with this new global environment , make the hard decisions , I say do n't you count us out .
We may not have had good leadership the last six years , but we are still the best , most able , can-do country in the world .
Former Senator John Edwards , also in the race , of course , and he will join us at 8:15 Eastern .
Stay tuned for that -- Soledad .
There was a prince in the city , and they rolled out the red carpet in Philadelphia and New York this weekend for Britain 's Prince Charles and his wife Camilla .
Charles was here to accept an environmental award , but the trip , though , is raising some questions across the pond , as they say .
AMERICAN MORNING 's Alina Cho has that story .
Good morning .
Hey , good morning , Soledad .
They think he 's a hypocrite there , right ?
Yes .
Sort of getting mixed reviews , you might say .
You know , Prince Charles and his wife , Camilla , charmed Americans this weekend , but some in Britain say by coming to the U.S. the so-called green prince is a hypocrite .
Either way , there was plenty of pomp and circumstance this weekend .
In fact , you might say fit for a royal .
To ask you to come forward and to accept this award as the tenth anniversary global environmental citizen .
Congratulations .
Former Vice President Al Gore presented Prince Charles with a special honor for his efforts to protect the environment .
I ca n't tell you how touched and grateful I am for all these extraordinary flattering words that are being said about me .
I find it rather strange after all these years of being the end of a certain amount of abuse .
And all I can say is fame at last , so it 's encouraging .
