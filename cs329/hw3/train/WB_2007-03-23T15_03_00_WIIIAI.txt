Today George Bush celebrated Greek independence day , the anniversary of the day Delta House declared independence from the tyrannical rule of Dean Wormer .
And then he looked into the big brown eyes of Archbishop Demetrios ...
âOne of the joys about being the President is you get to meet some pretty interesting people , â  he said .
âAnd it gives me great -- it soothes my spirit to be with you ,â  he said .
â I thank you for your spirituality , â  he said .
And then he celebrated a little Greek independence of his own , if you know what I mean .
