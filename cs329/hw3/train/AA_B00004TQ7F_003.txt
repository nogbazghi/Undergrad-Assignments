This is a cheaply made piece of junk .
The materials and craftsmanship are well below average .
It just feels cheap .
The first problems I encountered were with the water bottles .
Sometimes they leak , sometimes they do n't work at all .
It 's just not a good design - very unreliable .
Next problem , the motor started making noises after only a few months of continuous operation .
Eventually the motor burned up completely after only 5 months of use .
Seems like this unit was not designed to be run continuously .
If you only plan to use it a few hours a day , it might last you a couple of years .
Do n't waste your money on anything from Essick Air .
They do n't build quality products .
