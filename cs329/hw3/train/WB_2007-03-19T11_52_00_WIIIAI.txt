Bush gave a little speech for the 4th anniversary ( 8 Friedman Units ) of the Old Iraq War , with a painting of Teddy Roosevelt , presumably in Cuba , behind him .
He did nât spend much time on the Old Iraq War , which was initiated âto eliminate the threat [Saddam Husseinâs ] regime posed to the Middle East and to the world .â 
He moves right on before you can ask , âWithout the WMDs you said he had , what threat was that , monkey boy ?â 
Itâs another clean-slate moment for George , like quitting drinking and 9/11 .
He wants us to forget the boring Old Iraq War and focus on the New Iraq War , the âBaghdad security plan .â 
The New Iraq War is bright and fresh and , ya know , new , and is nât bogged down after four long years , no , itâs âstill in the early stages ,â  so what are you people being all impatient about ?
It will âtake months , not days or weeks .â 
So , 4 or 30 times longer .
âIt can be tempting , â  he says , âto look at the challenges in Iraq and conclude our best option is to pack up and go home .
That may be satisfying in the short runâ  but blah blah contagion of violence blah safe haven blah blah .
Yes , opposition to the war is all about giving in and doing whatâs âsatisfying , â  itâs just self-indulgence and you people make me sick .
