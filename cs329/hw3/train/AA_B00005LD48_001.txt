I had my kitchen aid mixer for over 10 years , with a bread hook that I use constantly .
Unfortunately , I have placed it in the dishwasher too many times , and know now , that was a no-no....
It eventually wore out from dishwashing it .
I am so thankful I was able to replace my new dough hook , knowing that it was needed to make bread for over 250 people within this month .
I received my dough hook in time from Amazon .
Yes , I continue to make bread with my kitchen aid hook , but , will be handwashing it from now on , which is not that hard to do .
