My family loves old fashioned , real milk shakes .
This product works like a dream and I made a perfect milk shake on the first attempt .
It is sort of big and I was trying to find a place to store it in my kitchen and my family laughed .
Keep it on the counter , they said , it wo n't be worth your time to put it away !
It is worth every penny ! ! !
