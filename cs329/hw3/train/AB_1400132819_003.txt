As a long time WWII history buff I can recommend this book without reservation .
The author has researched this book very well and presents the facts in a compelling fashion .
I was expecting certain passages to regarding how the Japanese-American population at home was treated to be one of finger-pointing , over-sentimentalization and playing the victim to gain sympathy .
Boy was I wrong .
Negative aspects of "exclusion" , internment , and racism , are on the page but so are the bravery and resolve of these people to overcome them .
The removal of the Japanese-American population from the west coast of the mainland while leaving the population of Japanese-Americans in Hawaii intact is spelled out in a way for the reader to discover the idiocy in it .
For instance the reason given to the "evacuation " was the proximity of Japanese-Americans to military bases and facilities .
Yet one of the future members of the 442d worked at Pearl Harbor helping to repair the facilities in the weeks and months after the attack !
This book brings to light a story that should be read .
