" A life-changing book " is what my 35 year old daughter told me after reading the copy of Cardio-Free Diet I gave her .
Using Caras ' program , she is very successfully getting back into shape after her second baby in 15 months .
I 've lifted weights for 30 years but did lots of cardio too .
I realize now it was the weight-lifting , not the cardio , that has kept me in shape ( plus a healthy vegetarian diet too . )
Caras ' book encouraged me to lift heavier and for the past several months I have been and really like the changes in my appearance and strength .
And though I 've been encouraging my husband for years to lift , it was n't until he read Caras ' book that he started to and he loves the results .
We 're both in our 60s and to all our fellow baby-boomers , I want to say , " Lift and stay strong as you get older and you 'll way slow down the aging process . "
