Okay .
But that was -- and they had , ah , the armed guards at the airport and stuff .
Okay .
And other than that , um , you see a lot of , um , army personnel .
Mhm .
You know , that are about in travelling along the way and she questions , my daughter does , excuse me , you know , " Why -- why -- why we see so much of this Mommy" , and , you know , it 's like what do you tell them .
Right .
Especially for that age .
Yeah .
I know in school they , um , you know , try to tell them bits and pieces of stuff .
Mhm .
But they do n't really go into the particulars .
Right .
You said she was five ?
She 's five , she 's in preschool .
Yeah .
Yeah .
She loves it .
I got a while until mine goes .
I think we 're gonna to put him in a precare first .
Yeah .
He 's three , I stay home with him .
And , oh , and every night before going to bed now she has to have the TV cut[ ? ] on so she 'll watch the news and she comes and she reports what she hears and what she sees .
Oh , yeah ?
Yeah , and she asks , " Why do -- why do man do that mommy " ?
I told her I did n't know .
You know , there 's a lot of that going on too .
Yeah .
Yeah .
Sounds very inquisitive .
Yes , a thousand questions from the time she gets up , if I 'm home , to the time she goes to bed , why , why , why .
Well , mine 's getting to the stage where everything is mine , mine , mine .
Okay .
" That 's mine , that 's mine " .
Yeah .
" That 's mine , that 's mine " and I say , " No , that 's mine" , " No , Momma that 's mine" , " Okay" .
Yeah .
You can have the vacuum if you want it .
Yeah .
He 's something , something else .
That 's it .
The other thing that goes on , now that I 'm thinking about it , like the guns , we 've seen some , you know , what with the guns , um , that have passed by .
Not to say that they were aiming them at anything but I guess in school they talked about how , you know , airplanes have guns on them .
Mhm .
And ships and things carry those , she asks , you know , " What -- what -- what are they going to do with those ? "
Yeah .
Um , " Why is it that they have to do that ? "
And -- and I guess the -- the hardest thing is just trying to explain in a language that she will understand that none of it is right .
Right , right .
But it 's being done to try to help , you know --
Mhm .
-- those people who achieve what she has , you know --
Exactly .
You know , do what they 'd like to do and not be punished because they did it .
