I` m a woman with two children at -- and a photographer and a writer .
And a philanthropist and an AIDS activist .
Come on .
Come on .
And I enjoy , you know , my past as being the world` s first supermodel and a writer and a photographer .
Now I have an agency .
Yes , but ...
People like me .
You`re known for what ?
Being the world` s first supermodel .
OK .
People like you .
Being really good at what I do .
People like you , models .
The fatter we get , the more obsessed we become with weight , the skinnier our models are getting .
To where you ...
Glenn ...
... brought it up a minute ago in -- was it Spain or was it Brazil ?
Two women come off of the runway and they ...
They die .
They die .
They just walk off and die .
Back in my day , I just walked off because , you know , for other reasons because the flash and -- too much champagne backstage .
Just stuff .
What` s changed ?
In 30 years , what` s changed ?
Absolutely nothing .
Women still strive to be -- you ca n` t be too rich or too thin .
That old motto that came from , I believe , a Jacklyn Suzanne ( ph ) novel .
You can never be too rich or too thin .
You know , the socialite women that starve themselves to get inside of couture dresses that are designed by the coterie .
Socialites , come on .
It` s a -- the buck does n` t stop with the model .
You might have perspective on what changed -- I mean , you go -- have you ever -- you`ve been to the Met and you`ve gone to the ...
Of course .
... Museum of Art .
You look at the old paintings of big fat women laying on couches .
That was the super model ...
Reubenesque period .
Reuben -- painting of Reubenesque style .
Women lounging or pateras ( ph ) , obese statues and so forth .
So you`ve got -- you`ve got the women who have fat , that was the image of beauty .
Not cool .
What happened ?
Not cool .
What happened ?
It was because you could n` t -- back then , it was a sign of life of leisure and wealth , right .
Times have changed .
Times have changed .
It` s a changing of the times .
And ...
Right ?
Eh ?
Is it changing of the times ?
Absolutely ?
From the `20s , and the `30s and the `40s .
In the `60s , Twiggy , the model , who` s a judge on " America` s Next Top Model" , the icon shot by Richard Abernon ( ph ) and David Bailey ( ph ) , was the first waif pin-thin , stick thin model ...
Right .
... of the day .
And everyone went crazy for her look .
And since then , since the `60s , there has n` t been another waif like model , with the exception of Kate Moss , who came along as the heroin chic waif - like model .
And all I` m saying ...
She is now the No. 1 in the world .
All I` m saying at this point is I believe I`ve only counted two bites of the sandwich .
Oh , please .
Come on .
I ca n` t talk and eat at the same time .
Well , I can .
