TEEPEN-COLUMN -- Who would ever have thought that 230 years after
we told the English king , George III , where to get
off , we would find ourselves in the hands of George
IV ?
But here we are .

SCHUETT-COLUMN -- GIBSONBURG , Ohio -- Two-year-old Benny is a "tuxedo " cat
-- all black except for a dazzling white shirt front ,
spotless gloves and immaculate spats .
A fine figure of a
fellow even though he has become a bit portly since
kittenhood .
Because of his attachment to the food dish and
a knack for coercing treats from his human , Benny 's dress
clothes require frequent alterations .
Coat buttons must be moved and
trousers let out to keep up with his expanding waistline .
Long ago we sewed elastic to the back of his
cummerbund .

LANE-COLUMN -- DAYTONA BEACH , Fla . -- The Florida Supreme Court last
week did what I expected it to do and found
the state 's voucher programs unconstitutional .
Everything else about the ruling
was a surprise .
Nor am I alone here .
People on
both sides of the question tend to view vouchers as
a church-and-state issue .
( Lane , Daytona Beach News-Journal ) MOVED.
GARCIA-COLUMN -- Arnold Garcia 's column is not available .
