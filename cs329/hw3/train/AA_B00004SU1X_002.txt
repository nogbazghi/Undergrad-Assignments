I would concur with the other fellow from Rochester- this machine is worth the price - the frothing mechanism is awesome and works consistently .
The 4 rather than 5 stars is because of the fact that if you have lots of folks to froth for- you will need to put more water in the reservoir ( to create the steam ) this is something I figured out by trial ...and now when it doesnt froth , I just check the res - and sure enough , it needs more H2O.
Also , I would like the spot under which the froth comes out to have more clearance ( i .e .
so I can put a big bucket there and leave it to froth on its own .
But as it is now , only a cup can fit there and you can spoon the froth into cups - making enough for about 2 ( maybe ) lattes .
But makes excellent coffee that stays hot for a long time .
Cannot pay this little for this type of machine with this capability .
So- all in all - I am very happy with it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
