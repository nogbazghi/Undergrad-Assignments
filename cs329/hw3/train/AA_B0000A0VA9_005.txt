This is a nice little basic vacuum .
We use it in the office for quick , spot cleanings between visits from our cleaning crew .
The machine is surprisingly powerful for such a small canister .
A retractable cord is a nice feature for a vacuum in this price range !
The bag was already installed so the vacuum was pretty much "plug and play " right out of the box .
