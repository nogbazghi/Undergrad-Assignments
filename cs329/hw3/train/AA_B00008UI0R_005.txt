This is best vacuum I have owned for picking up pet hair and even cat litter .
And if the vacuum will pick up after pets it will do everything else .
I have had a very expensive Electrolux canister that the motor fried and several uprights by Hoover and Eureka but nothing compares to this vacuum .
It is easy to use as it has many features that keep you from bending .
The on/off is on the handle , the cord return has a foot release , and the handle has a foot release to release the attachment from the wand .
The wand handle even expands/decreases very easily .
It really picks up everything so you have to be careful because it suck up loose items that no other vacuum has touched .
( like a newspaper ) The bagless is easy to use and I love never having to try and figure out if we have any bags and if so where are they .
I have replaced the filter but other reviewers say it is washable so I am going to try that next time .
We just moved so this vacuum really got a workout cleaning 2 houses .
The hose is longer than my other vacuums so it has can reach our stairs .
I cannot think of a thing that I do n't like about this vacuum .
