I was introduced to The Food Doctor Everyday Diet while visiting a friend in the U.K. recently .
I was sceptical at first .
In the month that I was there , my friend who had been using the advice in the book all year , cooked according to the author .
I lost 10 lbs ...never was hungry ...and feel wonderful ! !
It is the best ever ! !
For me , having taken nutrition coursework , the book made perfect sense .
I only had to " tweak " my diet a little bit .
So , I had to have my own copy !
Well worth doing the diet ...try it for a month ...and you will see ! ! WANNA FEEL BETTER ?
HAVE BETTER HEALTH ?
Also get : The Food Doctor - Fully Revised and Updated : Healing Foods for Mind and Body This book has helped me also...in that it contains recipes for specific health issues .
