Halfway through a LAT story about a bill to require schools in Texas to offer an elective class on the history & literature of the Bible , after hearing the twaddle about how the classes would nât be religious indoctrination but actual larninâ , we find that the bill states that the primary textbook would be the Bible itself .
Other books could be used , but it would nât be required , because , sponsor Warren Chisum , the chair of the Texas House Appropriations Committee who does not believe in evolution or that the earth revolves around the sun , explained , itâs just convenient : âItâs the most available book in the world .â 
While John McCain says he has âno Plan Bâ  for Iraq , he admits that if he became president the force of public opinion might force him to end the war : â I do believe that history shows us Americans will not continue to support an overseas engagement involving the loss of American lives for an unlimited period of time unless they see some success .â 
I donât know the tone in which he said this , having read it but not heard it , but I suspect McCain , like Bush , considers it a moral failing that Americans wonât support an overseas engagement involving the loss of American lives for an unlimited period of time unless they see some success .
Alberto Gonzales has an op-ed piece in the WaPo about the US attorneys scandal , in advance of his testimony before Congress this week .
He says four times that nothing improper occurred ( it is also the headline of the piece ) .
One looks forward to seeing congresscritters pin down his definition of improper , assuming they can get Joe Biden to shut the hell up .
Gonzo says , âDuring those conversations [with Kyle Sampson] , to my knowledge , I did not make decisions about who should or should not be asked to resign .â 
Interesting qualifier .
To his knowledge he did nât make decision .
If he made decisions , it was without his own knowledge .
