I love this thermometer .
It measures both freezer and refrigerator temperatures and gives you current readings plus weekly averages for each .
The sticky stuff on the back of the main unit actually works , even with refrigerator moisture , so the unit stays out of the way and you do n't have to worry about it getting knocked over or shoved to the back or sideways where you ca n't see it .
It takes AAA batteries , so no special batteries required .
It also matches my favorite non-digital refrigerator thermometer in terms of accuracy and has helped me to discover that there is a 10 degree difference in temperature between my refrigerator 's top and bottom shelves , so now I store things more appropriately and can be assured of food safety .
This is a great product .
