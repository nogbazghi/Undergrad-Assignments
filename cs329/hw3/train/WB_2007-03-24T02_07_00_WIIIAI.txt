From the Guardian , more on the increasing authoritarianism of Russia .
Lots of details , including the banning of yet another party , but here âs my favorite bit :
The mayor âs office [in Nizhny Novgorod ] announced a childrenâs festival on the site of the proposed march , and blocked off the road to carry out what it said were urgent repairs .
Speaking of rallies , the USâs Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns , at the Council of Americas , said that Argentina should nât have allowed Hugo Chavez to hold his rally in Buenos Aires at the same time as Bush was in Uruguay earlier this month .
â I did nât think that was the right thing to do . â  Really , when George Bush is speaking , itâs just good manners for everyone on whatever continent heâs speaking on to keep quiet and still and listen respectfully .
Were you people born in a granero ?
