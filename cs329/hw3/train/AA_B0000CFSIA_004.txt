I ordered these thinking they were the 23 ounce version of the pop-ins , they are not they are about 2/3 the size .
I have 3 of the 23 ounce version .
The bigger ones are great for me for taking a lunch to work because I can put all my lunch in there , a meat and a couple of sides .
Unfortunately if you are like me and like to stuff as much as you can into as small a space as you can , you end up breaking the lid .
Yes , I broke 3 lids .
I had been using them for about 7 years before without a problem .
These were a replacement for the bigger ones .
The smaller ones ca n't really fit a full lunch inside of them , probably a meat and maybe one side .
That 's not great because now I 'll need to carry 2 of them to bring a full lunch .
They also are n't as thick ( i .e .
durable ) ceramic as the bigger ones .
I ca n't really complain about them except for the size .
They work fine otherwise .
