i researched alot of vacuums ... this one passed test and got stubborn ,embedded labrador retriever dog hair out of cargo area of our carpetted suv.nothing else worked .
only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is tools hardly store nicely[2 of 5 store in vacuum ,the other 3 are just stored loose ....ive never had a canister before , always an upright but like it and not so heavy to use and vacuum path is not as wide as some uprights but easier to use under chairs ,etc
