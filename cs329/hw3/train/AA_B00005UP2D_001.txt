I 've had mine for about 4 years - We have shorthaired dogs and I vaccuum before carpet cleaning .
Immediately I discovered that there is no way to open up the front suction area to clean the unit ( even thought there are screws ) .
Now the water tank leaks through the rubber connector .
The last time I used it , the water leaked out of the tank quickly as soon as I put the handle down to push the unit .
It is also hard to totally clean out the dirty water tank .
Clearly I have a dog hair problem - however I would n't have a complaint if I could open the unit up and clean out the hair .
The suction was always good and I was happy the way it cleaned , however I wish I had bought a brand that heated the water for even better cleaning .
