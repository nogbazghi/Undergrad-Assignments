Just wanted to warn folks that Amazon 's dimensions info is incorrect .
Do not go by their 10 " x 9 " description , as this top is considerably smaller .
I 'm thinking these are the dimensions for the 2-1/2 quart version .
Other than that , the top is perfectly fine and it 's nice that replacements are available .
