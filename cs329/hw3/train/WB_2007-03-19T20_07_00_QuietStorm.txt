I love hearing these armchair generals who are nowhere near the frontline ( and do n't have children there , either ) and who are willing to fight to the last drop of other people 's blood talk about what 's " satisfying " or self-indulgent or defeatist .
It 's real easy to talk tough from the plush interior of the White House .
