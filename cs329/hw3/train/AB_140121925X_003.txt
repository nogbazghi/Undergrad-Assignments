This book has all the graphic novels from the time-frame from when season one ended to when season two would have ended if not for the writer 's strike .
That 's basically all it has in it .
There are Isaac Mendez paintings spaced throughout , but no commentaries or extra info or anything beyond the graphic novels .
The novels are good and I love having them in a hardback form , but I was hoping to be rewarded with something extra .
