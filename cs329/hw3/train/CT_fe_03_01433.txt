But , uh , it 's just -- I -- I mean , I guess it just changed your whole way of thinking .
It does .
It does .
We -- in fact , down the block here , we have a gas station that was closed down for about five months because they found -- and the guy who ran the gas station , he was , uh , uh , a -- a dark kind of -- I do n't know , wha - what is that -- I do n't know , like Iraqi .
Wha - what you see the Iraqis look like .
He 's like that .
Yeah .
But I went there anyway , because I figured , well you know , that I ca n't be prejudiced against all these people , you know ?
Yeah .
Well , they closed down the gas station 'cause they found out that that gas station was supplying money to Al Qaida .
Oh , my goodness .
Yeah .
Now , it -- it 's been opened up after the five months , but I have n't gone back yet because now I 'm like , wow , they were supplying the people who we 're fighting against and now , sh - you know , I 'm not rushing to go back to that station , you know ? because now I feel , I feel that they -- that gas station did wrong .
I mean , I guess they were -- they were , uh , found not guilty or they paid their fines or whatever --
Mhm .
-- but still , they -- th - they were found that they did something wrong like that , and when you have these young people dying over there --
Yeah .
-- you know ?
And being held prisoner and everything now , of course you 're going to , you know , feel negative towards those type of people .
Yeah .
Yeah , it -- it really does make you -- it change your whole way of thinking , things that you would n't of , uh , paid any attention before , you know , you just -- you know , you just figure that they -- they were Americans or -- or in this country .
I mean , we have such a vast mixture of people --
Mm .
-- you know , in this country , that you just did n't -- you -- pay it no attention , but now , it 's just totally , um , uh , different .
Yeah .
Yeah .
It -- it 's really made you -- I think it 's made us probably also look at our lives in general and say , okay now , do -- do -- is our life going in the right direction that we 've always wanted it to be ? Because , you know , any minute since now , you -- it 's made more -- uh , you realize more that it can be taken away from you , so am I going the right way ?
Is there something I want to change here ?
Do I want to reach more out to other people ?
Um , you know ?
You know what I 'm saying ?
Yeah .
