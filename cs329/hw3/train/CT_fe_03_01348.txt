-- I mean , but that just continues -- it opens up an avenue for discussion , you know --
Exactly .
-- if you -- if you read it together .
Or even if you do n't read it together , if you kind of know what 's going on in the book and it brings up --
Mhm .
-- things that they 'll talk to you about --
Right .
-- um , it does n't really matter to me what level it 's at because I 'd rather them hear anything and everything from me first --
Right .
-- you know , and if there is a topic in a book that --
Hm .
-- you know , I may be uncomfortable with , I 'd still rather they bring it up with me --
Exactly .
-- than anybody else , so --
Exactly .
-- um , anyway .
Yeah .
So , now , does someone like read this -- someone listen to our conversation and then use that to --
I do n't know -- I have no idea --
-- this is the first one I 've done .
Have you done --
Me too .
Yeah .
This is the first one I 've done .
Yeah .
And did you find out for it a while ago ?
Yes .
And I -- it was funny , I was just thinking , " Gosh , you know , I never got anything about that " --
Right .
-- " I never got a call " --
No, ah , because I remember I signed up for it , um , during my kids ' spring break , which was actually like a month ago --
Yeah .
-- and , um , and I thought , well , I guess I just missed it --
-- but , um , I do n't know what happens from here .
Yeah , no , and I guess -- it said something about ten minutes , so I guess after ten -- let me see what my phone says --
I wonder if they , um --
Oh , it 's only been , it 's not even eight minutes yet since I answered the phone --
It 's not even eight minutes ?
Not since I even answered --
Well , I wonder if , um , um , I wonder if they try to match people from different areas of --
Well , when I -- I -- you know , they asked me a bunch of questions and I punched in and they said let 's find another participant , so maybe , or that was just what kind of phone am I on .
Yeah .
Yeah .
I had that , too .
But , um --
So --
-- because I live --
-- I do n't know if they come back on or you 're just supposed to -- I do n't know .
I do n't know .
Be done with it .
I do n't know .
I guess we 'll wait for ten minutes and see .
Right .
So , where do you live ?
