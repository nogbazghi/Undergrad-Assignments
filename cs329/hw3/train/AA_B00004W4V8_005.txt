These clean-a-screens work as expected .
The small mesh grid keep things ( like peas ) from falling through the dehydrator .
The screens are flexible so they are great for putting under sticky fruits so you can just pop stuff off .
If you are using a juicy/sticky fruit , your main trays will still get sticky and need washed .
The screens only make it easier to empty the dehydrator .
