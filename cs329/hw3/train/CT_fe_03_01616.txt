One 's in the marines , one 's in the air force .
Um , well , the marine has been out there since , oh , my gosh , like three weeks before it started .
Mhm .
And my brother in the air force , about three or four days before it started .
Mhm .
Yeah .
He 's a flier so ...
How much longer could it be that they have to stay ?
Um , I do n't know .
I think my brother in the air force will be coming home sooner than the one in the marines .
The one in the marines , he just -- they dismantle landmines and stuff so -- and stuff like that and --
Mhm .
-- clear the area of -- of dangerous materials and stuff like that so I think they 'll be there a while .
Mhm .
So , and then I do n't know , I -- I have a feeling that this is n't quite all -- I do n't -- I do n't -- I do n't think they 're -- they 're quite done .
I got , you know , unless Syria starts listening to us , ah , we may be going into their back door now .
Mhm .
I just kind of have that feeling .
Yeah , yeah , I heard them talking about that .
Yeah .
So that --
So maybe that 's why they have n't declared victory yet .
What kind of government do they have ?
Syria ?
Mhm .
Um , their -- their president -- he just -- it 's hard to -- it 's kind of -- it 's a dictatorship .
His father was horrible .
Mhm .
The one in charge now they really do n't know a lot about him .
Mhm .
You know , he 's -- he was -- you know , pretty close with Iraq and the other na - Arab nations but also had a lot of ties with our government and the French government too .
Mhm .
And Russia and everybody .
So it 's really hard to tell , you know , where their loyalties lie .
Mhm .
So I think they 're defiant against us anyway in th - -- You see , even with the Iraqi people , I know they 're glad that , you know , we got rid of Saddam Hussein for 'em , but they do n't want us there , you can see that .
Mhm .
They 'd feel better .
Yeah .
What about , ah , -- what about Afghanistan ?
I heard that it 's getting -- it 's still , like , pretty dangerous ?
Yeah , I saw that last -- on -- last night on Fox news that some of the , like , suicide bombers are -- are trying to attack soldiers there and , but maybe that 's just remnants of what 's been going on in Iraq .
Mhm .
Yeah .
I think for the most part Afghanistan -- I think the Afghan- Afghanistan people are much more happy with what -- the change in their government and stuff .
Mhm .
Than what 's going on with Iraq right now .
I do n't know if they really have any particular group of people that really want to run Iraq .
