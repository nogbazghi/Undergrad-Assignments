Cinematic Storytelling is a key tool for filmakers and screenwriters trying to translate their skills to the visual realm of filmaking .
The author combines examples from great films throughout history along with a discussion of human perceptions to illustrate how certain visual actions illicit deep reactions in audiences without words .
Although , geared for aspiring filmakers , as a screenwriter I found the discussions very thought provoking and useful in my efforts to more fully understand how to create evocative visual imagery and get across important concepts and messages through visual means .
I found this book very inspiring and have consulted it frequently in my screenwriting endeavors .
Kudos to the author for providing a no nonsense , useful guide to creating truly visual films and screenplays .
