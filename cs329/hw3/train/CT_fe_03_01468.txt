Mhm .
-- if it had been in Chicago somewhere .
Mhm .
And , you know , and it makes you w- and I always wonder , since I do n't live in the downtown sector , I always say , " Well , if these things are gonna happen , they gonna hit buildings downtown --
Mhm .
-- first " .
You know ?
Yeah .
Or near the airport .
Well , see , May nineteenth we had -- oh , April nineteenth , we had the bombing here .
Mhm .
In , uh , ninety five .
Right .
Um , and , um I did n't even think with that I -- I still do n't -- I do n't remember changing my routine , really .
Mhm .
All that much .
Even during that .
You know .
And it was here .
Right .
Um , I -- I think I 've just , you know , learned or just , you know , just went on .
Yeah .
Just went on .
I mean , it 's kinda hard to -- to stop your life .
Right .
And I did n't have anyone , you know , affected by it --
Mhm .
-- as far as in the bombing .
So that ma - --
Yeah , you did n't know anyone personally either --
Right .
-- you know , i- it --
Right .
-- makes a difference , I think --
Mhm .
-- when you have people -- it 's the same way like , when the war started .
I feel sorry for the families that got , you know , have children --
Mhm .
-- and especially families that have two children in the war .
Right .
Right .
But when it does n't affect you and your immediate family --
Mhm .
-- the only thing you can do is to pray for the --
Right .
-- safe return of all the other people .
Right .
But you just ca n't really stop , you know , I mean , you just ca n't get yourself in a tizzy over --
Mhm .
-- and so you -- you 'd be a nervous wreck .
Oh yeah , oh yes , yeah .
You have to grip yourself and like I tell people , that you just have to trust in God and trust your faith and --
Mhm .
-- you know .
And all this is -- I feel this really in his hands , you know ?
Y - yeah .
And a lot of this , I mean , this w- the war , the bombings , you know , they make you think twice about how strong your faith is .
Right .
How strong , you know , um and I think that 's why , you know , some people are able to go on .
Mhm .
And just , you know , well , if it happens it happens .
Yes , that 's right .
You know ?
And -- and -- and it 's like for myself , I 'm at that point where , you know , my everyday life I 'm just , you know , if it happens , it happens .
