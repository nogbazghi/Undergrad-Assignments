In fairness , North Carolina 's minimum wage is overdue to be raised .
Inflation has chipped away at the value of $ 5.15 , the
minimum hourly wage required by federal law nine years ago .
Today , it takes $ 6.26 to buy what $ 5.15 bought in
1997 .
Against that background , it 's apparent that State Treasurer Richard Moore is n't
climbing too far out on a limb with his proposal
that the state minimum wage be raised to $ 6.15 an
hour .
Nevertheless , it takes moxie to call for even that
modest increase in front of business groups that have steadfastly
resisted any increase at all .
Understandably , Moore does n't spend much time extolling the benefits of an
extra dollar an hour to workers .
Members of the N.C .
Citizens for Business and Industry have been more concerned that
raising the minimum would drive up labor costs enough to
crimp profits .
Moore 's case rests on the effect that bare-minimum employers have on
their competition : The more their workers are forced into public
programs , the more tax revenue must be collected from businesses
to pay for them .
Taxes crimp profits , too .
Because of a rosy economic outlook , now is an opportune moment
to even things up for employers and workers alike .
Business
investment and expansion predicted for this year promise to blunt
the impact of higher labor costs on bottom lines .
Besides , higher wages would serve North Carolina 's goal of stimulating the
economy beyond its growing cities .
More money in the hands
of low-skill workers would be spent in areas of the
state without many high-paying jobs .
Workers earning the current minimum wage ca n't afford to shop at
Wal-Mart stores , one reason why Wal-Mart 's chairman recently called on
Congress to raise the federal minimum .
A simpler reason for
lawmakers to act would be fairness to hard-working people .
