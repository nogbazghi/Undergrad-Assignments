While the book is well made and quite educational , I can not avoid but see the bias of the publisher in presenting the "world . "
I almost wonder what world are they presenting ?
P. 52-53 the " City " depicting NYC without WTC , and the picture of a Mosque in the middle of their " city " ( no other religious buildings there i .e . no church or synagogue near by ) .
Living in post 9/11 America I find this offensive .
This is certainly not the "world " I would want my child to live in .
