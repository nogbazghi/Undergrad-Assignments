Yeah , they had a summer program , but he just got to a certain level or a certain , ah -- well , he just decided that he did n't want to pursue it anymore after taking it in high school and --
Oh .
-- kind of got tired of it .
It 's too bad .
Yeah .
Oh , yeah .
Well , it 's a --
But as -- as I -- it is a tough -- tough field to make any money in , I 'm sure .
Yeah --
Yeah .
-- it 's tough , but I mean -- I mean , if you really want to do it , there 's ways to make money --
Yeah .
-- a lot of people get sc - -- get scared because of , um , you know , the old , ah , adage that , you know , it 's going -- you 're going to be poor and living on the street --
Yeah .
-- but you 'd be am - amazed how much , ah -- just like graphic designers --
Yeah , I was just going to say on the computer end of it and graphics and things , yeah .
Yeah , everything 's computers now .
Yeah .
Mhm .
So , even though you do , um , an art , you have to go back to school --
Yeah .
-- and then learn how to do it to -- with the computers .
But ah --
Right .
Mhm .
-- you know , it 's a --

Mhm .
-- like as far as like the work place --
Yeah .

Mhm .
-- then I can have -- I can use the , ah , federal law to sue em .
Well , yeah .
Yeah , but I mean you have to -- the -- you have to have some proof , you know ?
Uh-huh .
That 's pretty hard to prove , but yeah if -- if there was something that happened during the interview process --
Mhm .
-- where somebody made a derogatory comment obviously or something else happened that -- you know , where you could prove that you did n't get hired because of your race .
But you know , normally that 's -- it 's tough to do that .
Oh , [inaudible] .
If you 're a woman , it 's a little bit easier , because you know , depending on the questions they ask you -- if they start asking you personal questions like , um , are you pregnant or do you expect to be pregnant , you know , those kind of things , ah --
