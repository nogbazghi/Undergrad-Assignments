This corning ware product is great for individual servings .
I 'm very busy so often cook on sunday for the week .
I put about 8 servings into these dishes and freeze for the week .
If I 'm too tired to fix something when I get home I pull a meal from the freezer and it 's ready to go .
I do n't like to reheat in the microwave in plastic .
I think this is a much healthier alternative .
They are also the perfect size for one serving .
They are sturdy and last just about forever incuding the cover .
I have n't had the same luck with other products .
They would be a little difficult to use for an older adult however because the top on the newer version is more difficult to remove .
CorningWare Pop-Ins 8-Piece Oval Bake and Serve Set I 've used them for several years and they are my first choice for my busy life style .
