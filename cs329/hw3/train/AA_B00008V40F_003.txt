I should have read the reviews before I purchased the Dirt Devil .
I had similar problems with the crevice tool , but the motor broke down before the tool had a chance to really make me crazy !
It would start to whine like the RMP 's were climbing into the red zone and a terrible burning smell would come out after a few minutes of use .
I was so mad I just threw the whole thing away .
Yesterday I bought Black and Decker 's Dustbuster ( 7.2V ) and am so much happier with it 's performance .
