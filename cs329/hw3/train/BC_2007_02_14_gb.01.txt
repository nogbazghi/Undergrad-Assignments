So now the issue became how do you sell the ring , right ?
Exactly .
I tried to go back to my jeweler to sell the ring , and they only wanted to give me 32 percent back .
You know , I spent my life savings on this .
You know , I ca n` t take a big loss like that .
Oh , man .
We`ve got to get you a woman .
Are you all right now ?
Yes , I` m actually -- you know , I` m dating someone right now .
I`ve often heard it said , and I think you`re confirming this , that these engagement rings are like cars .
You know , the minute you drive off the lot , the thing has decreased incredibly so in value .
So it` s the same with diamond rings .
Exactly .
Same way .
Except I think it decreases more .
Are they tainted stones ?
Aren` t they , like , hexed ?
I mean , like , if the next one that you`re going to give it to , the next female that you`re going to , you know , odd the odds ( ph ) to , if she finds out this is a used ring that went south before , I do n` t know if that` s going to work .
Well , I do n` t think that` s such a big deal to some people .
Someone` s bad luck could be someone else` s good luck .
Glass half full .
Or you just do n` t tell her .
You know ?
Yes .
You do n` t have to tell her .
Also , you know , say you sell your ring back to a jewelry store .
I guarantee that they take the diamond out and you can be buying someone else` s ring and you just do n` t know it .
You know what ?
That` s true .
I mean , they never crush the stones .
Right ?
No.
Chances are that ring has be on somebody` s finger at some point .
And I never thought of that .
Exactly .
What do they go for on the web site ?
How much will someone have to spend ?
So far , I`ve been seeing this -- you`ll probably get 50 to 60 percent of your value .
But we have rings on there from $ 600 to $ 19,000 .
So it goes all ranges .
And then what` s the house cut ?
What` s the big ?
We only take 5 percent of the ring .
And then the reaction among jewelers ?
I` m sure they`re not too thrilled to see you`ve entered the marketplace , so to speak ?
You know , actually , some jewelers did n` t mind this .
They do n` t get that much .
You know , most of them do n`t , you know , sell back the ring anyway .
But yes , I guess I` m taking away some business from the jewelry business .
There` s always that battle : who gets the ring ?
Is it hers to keep ?
Is it -- you know , is it the guy who gave it to her ?
And that goes on and on .
It always gets litigated .
Look , we thought it was important to have you here with this very happy Valentine` s Day story .
So thank you , Joshua .
Thank you .
We`ll be back right after this .
Why have Glenn read your hate mail when you can tell him to his face ?
