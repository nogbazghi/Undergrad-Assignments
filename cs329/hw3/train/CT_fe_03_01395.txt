I mean , yeah , that was several years ago now so --
Yeah , we do a lot of watching sports here in this household .
Mhm , mhm .
We do n't even do -- really do much of that --
Yeah , yeah .

Just , you know , here and there but not --
We watch baseball and hockey , are the big ones so ...
Which one ?
Baseball and hockey and then sometimes soccer if we can get it .
Oh , I see .
Where -- where are you from ?
I 'm from Seattle .
Oh , okay .
And my boyfriend is from , oh , Czechoslovakia actually .
Oh my ! Oh my , I 'm impressed .
Yeah and , um , so he 's a big soccer fan and --
Oh , that 's neat .
-- hockey fan and all that stuff .
So , he 's got me interested in that but not playing though !
Yeah , yeah .
Yeah , that does n't really do much for us .
I have a sister from Wolamar[ ?] .
Oh really ?
Mhm .
That 's on the other side .
So , I used go out there every --
Yeah .

Oh .
So , was it rainy today in Seattle ?
No, it was beautiful today .
Really ?
Oh , that 's good .
We 've had beautiful weather .
We 've had a lot of rain but today was nice , the cherry trees are just moving their petals now and --
Really .
-- there 's still a few other flowering trees so --
Wow .
It 's getting nicer actually to walk outside so maybe I will be doing some more .
Yeah .
Well now , tell me , are the leaves on the trees yet ?
They 're just --
Or do they bloom first ?
Um , they -- let 's see , I never thought of it that way .
I think the blooms come first or maybe the leaves are smaller or something and I do n't notice them .
Mhm , do n't notice them .
I never thought of that .
No, but they 're just starting to fall now , the petals and --
Oh , I see .
What 's it like over there now ?
It 's sort of --
Well , it 's -- we 've had some nice days and we 've had some cold days and then we had snow and then we had more nice days .
You had snow ?
Recently ?
Yeah , we did about , um , I do n't know , a week or so ago .
Oh , I did think I hear about that on the news .
Amazingly enough .
Yeah .
But , um , we had , I do n't know , several inches but --
Mhm .
-- and it actually lasted about three days or so .
