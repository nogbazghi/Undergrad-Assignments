Robert A. Schulman , M.D. is well qualified to write on this important subject .
I know that his knowledge is based on formal training , extensive research and continuous clinical experience .
The clear format makes it easy to read and quickly find the information I am looking for .
For example , the defined supplements listed by title in part two are further divided into subheadings " What It does " , " How It Works " , " How To Take It" , " Look Out For This " and " What To Avoid " .
The medical issues in part three are briefly defined and the recommendations are divided into two sections , " What Should I Take " and " My Supplement List " .
As an obstetrician and gynecologist , I can see referring to this source of information as I would other sources such as " Up To Date" , the " PDR" and " Drugs in Pregnancy and Lactation " by Briggs , Freeman and Yaffee .
As a point of criticism , or perhaps more so a point of recommendation , a quarterly or at minimum a semi annually update of his work is essential .
Perhaps Dr. Schulman can post these changes on his web site .
An example of this is the absence of the more current information on cervical dysplasia , such as HPV typing and the most current information on the HPV vaccine .
This work has become a sorely needed reference for me .
I keep it handy and use
It frequently .
I have purchased several copies to give as gifts to family members , close friends and colleagues .
