Durst : âMitt Romney bragging about being a lifelong hunter , then admitting heâs only been hunting twice .
... Same kind of thinking qualifies George Bush as a lifelong reader .â 
This morning George Bush attended the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast .
He totally killed , or they were totally drunk : â I noticed that this yearâs breakfast was the Friday after Lent -- ( laughter ) -- you can eat your bacon in good conscience .
( Laughter . )
And the priests can relax .
( Laughter . )â  
Thatâs a lot of laughing .
Is there such a thing as a bacon high ?
He told the National Catholics , âPrayer breakfasts show the true strength of our nation .â 
That strength : delicious bacon .
He came out in favor of Catholic schools , a âculture of life , â  and immigration reform , and concluded , âAnd I ask that you pray that in a troubled world , America may always remain a beacon of hope and of freedom .â 
Or possibly a bacon of hope and of freedom .
