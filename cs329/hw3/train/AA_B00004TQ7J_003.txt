We bought this product , as part of our Dr.
Weil '8 Weeks to Optimum Health ' regimen .
And , we really love it .
During the winter , when the bedroom gets so dry , the humidifier really does the trick .
And , it may be in our heads , but the air really does seem to be cleaner than in the rest of the house .<p>This
product has great air quality ratings ( HEPA , etc. ) relative to other products in its price range , and was easy to set up , etc.<p>Our only gripe is that it is a bit of a pain to clean .
You need to take it all apart , etc .
However , this may be the case with all of these products , and thus , may just be par for the course .<p>We
recommend this product whole-heartedly .
