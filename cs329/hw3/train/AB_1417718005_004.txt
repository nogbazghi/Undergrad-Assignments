Simply geniusly told , it 's amazing how someone can come up with such a story-riddle .
Is it four stories or is it one story ?
Certain to spark discussions as one hint after the other reveals a little more .
A book unlike any other .
Smart and fun entertainment .
Beautifully illustrated .
David Macaulay at his best .
