Mhm .
But it is --
I know , it 's very interesting .
-- it is kinda interesting .
It is .
It 's -- it 's neat to kinda think of what somebody else is doing at that time of the day because , you know , they could be sleeping or , you know , it 's just totally different circumstance for them .
Yeah .
And , um , one of my friends is from Brazil .
And so not only is there -- the time difference is n't so much , but the , um , the seasons .
Mhm .
All of that , you know .
Exactly .
For us growing up in New Zealand , it was summer at Christmastime and , uh , coming here -- mhm -- uh , you know , it 's a whole different thing to have a white Christmas .
So , that was kinda interesting .
It -- it 's kinda neat .
And boy did we .
Yeah .
I imagine it is , and sounds like you 've got some young ones , so --
Yes .
-- they got to -- they got to enjoy some --
-- some of the white Christmas , too , I imagine .
Yes , they both have .
Their first Christmas had a white Christmas .
They 're keeping me busy .
Press the button .
There you go .
I understand that very well .
Very well .
Mine 's --
Do you have children ?
I 've got one .
He 's -- he 's pretty -- pretty much grown up now .
Yeah , he 's -- well , he thinks he 's forever grown up , but , you know .
H- how old is he ?
Sixteen .
Oh , yeah .
So , yeah , they -- at that age they -- they 're grown up .
They do n't wanna be bothered with us but ...
Starting to get pretty independent , I 'm sure .
Yeah .
And , in fact , the other day he had -- I forgot what he was -- what he was -- he was looking up something on the compu- -- you know , on the computer , and he sent me a link to a couple of si- -- of websites --
-- you know , that had , like , cu- -- I guess , like , current events , something like that --
Mhm .
-- on 'em that I had n't even -- you know , I usually deal with going to , you know , MSNBC or -- or something like that , but he -- he showed me another one which offered a totally different point of view .
And I thought , " Well , that 's kind of " --
Hm .
I thought -- at first I thought , " Well , that 's kinda weird " but --
Well --
-- then I got -- I stopped and thought about it and then it 's , like , wait a minute , this is -- you know , actually it 's kinda neat that --
Mhm .
-- that they 're --
-- that they 're doing that .
Some p - -- you know , I 've seen a bunch of websites , though , that have got cad - -- you know , all condemning the war .
I 'm not real impressed with it per se but --
