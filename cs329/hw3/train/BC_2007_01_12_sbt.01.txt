But I would -- I mean , I`ve actually started back working , and -- and -- which is good , and I`ve done a pilot for a series that probably did n` t sell .
But -- and I did a movie of the week .
So -- you know , I`ve -- since I`ve the weight , I`ve been -- I`ve actually been stabilized for about four months now .

And you can see his unbelievable transformation in the Discovery Health special " Action Hero Makeover . "
It` s this Saturday on the Discovery Health Channel .
Well , tonight , the widow of Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin is opening up about the most difficult moment of her life .
Irwin , of course , died in September after a string ray barb pierced his heart .
In an interview with CNN` s Larry King , Terri Irwin talked about that horrible day , and what it was like breaking the news to their daughter , Bindi , and their son , Robert .
TERRI IRWIN , STEVE IRWIN` S WIDO
I told her straightforward and directly and honestly , as forthright as I could be .
Did you sit her down or you ...
She -- I -- she was in the car .
She` d run back to the car and I sat down with her and I said that -- that ...
What ?
... his dad had been -- her dad had been in an accident .
And I told her , as I had been told , exactly what happened .
And she , as expected , had a lot of tears , and so did I.
And it was very difficult then , because we had the next hurdles of getting out of Tasmania on a moment` s notice and getting back up to Queensland .
But telling -- telling Robert was rather eerie .
He finally woke up and I told him what had happened .
Did he understand ?
He asked me again .
I told him a second time .
And then he spent about half an hour just looking out the window .
He` s got a little pig .
He` s got it here with him today , a little piggy , and he just worked Piggy` s ears and looked out the window for about a half an hour .
It was really hard for him .
Well at 8 years old , Bindi Irwin is already following in her dad` s footsteps .
She` s starting a wildlife series for the Discovery Kids Network .
She also sat across from Larry King .
He asked her what it` s like now to see video of her famous father .
Is it hard to look at your dad ?
BINDI IRWIN , STEVE IRWIN` S DAUGHTE
Sometimes it is .
Sometimes I have good days and bad days .
Sometimes it brings back memories and it` s really nice .
And some days I just cry straight off .
What did you get from your father ?
Me ?
That you`re happiest about .
I got from my father the best kind of loving person .
He brought you love ?
