Yeah .
Because they did n't have what they thought they had .
They did n't have what it took .
That 's right .
Well , you know ?
Or the ones that get into professional sports and , you know , can only play -- or because they get hurt .
Mhm .
You know ?
And it 's like what were they--
And that 's another thing , they get , uh , all the -- the top doctors and -- and , oh , you know , um , you know , bone and --
Right .
-- um , um , even the exercise equipment and everything that they , uh , the techniques that they use and all are the top --
Mhm .
-- I mean , it 's not , you know , what the ordinary person can get .
Right .
Right .
You know ?
Yeah .
Which is wrong .
I mean , I think it should be to the -- everyone , not just --
Sure .

And that 's , you know ... I think the -- the perks are too much for the -- what they do .
Yeah , I -- I agree .
And I think given the right to strike --
Yeah , I agree .
I agree .
You know , I mean , yes , you need to be -- maybe they need to unionize , you know , as -- as players they need to unionize to be able to have a say in what the owners can do and a say --
Yeah .
-- in what the management can do , and what their agents can do .
Mhm .
You know ?
So , yeah , I agree with that as a collective bargaining agent , yeah , they should be able to do something like that .
But to be able to walk out when your job is --
They 've gotten --
-- to provide a service for the fans --
Yeah .
You know ?
And they 're -- they 're actually walking out on the fans themselves --
Yeah .
