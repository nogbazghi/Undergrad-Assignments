This was almost exactly what I was looking for .
I say almost , because it is not truly gold-plated ( not nearly as expensive as you 'd think . )
Real gold is much easier to clean , and to keep clean ; and it is chemically inert , so it ca n't react with other substances .
Otherwise , the Krups basket works very well .
Remember that the key reason for using one of these is to not have to use paper filters .
That makes this a very "green " item .
I recommend it .
