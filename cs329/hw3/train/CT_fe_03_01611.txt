-- but the fact was I 'm trying to make it safer .
I think it could be tougher for the terrorists to plan another --
True .
-- ah , attack , say , on -- with the airplanes .
Yeah .
So that 's good .
It might --
As tougher as we can make it , the better .
Yeah .
They might think twice about it , too , you know , may not -- not be so cocky about what they 're going to do and really think seriously about -- about it before they do it , so that would make a -- make a good id - good sense to 'em .
Yeah .
I -- I -- I do n't think they have the right , um , perception of what America is .
No, they do n't , they do n't , no .
My son in law is from Turkey and I have -- our ex son in law I should say , but he --
Mm .
-- he has a real different idea on -- on life in general and -- and really on the family --
Yeah .
-- and just on a lot of things and when you have somebody like that that 's in -- a member of your family basically , you kinda see where they 're -- not really where they 're coming from , but you can kinda better understand I think their -- their philosophy .
You know , if they do n't -- like , he 's been here --
Yeah .
-- about , oh , God , I guess he 's been here about seven years .
Mhm .
Almost seven years now and I can see where he 's changed a lot but I can still see every now and then his -- his heritage kind of creeps back into his attitudes of -- of life in general , you know , and they just really -- the family and -- and the family especially is just not important to those people .
Really ?
And it 's just -- it 's really sad that they can just -- life is just not an important thing , you know .
Wow .
And so that 's why the terror- that 's a lot of times --
I know they have different culture and beliefs .
Uh-huh .
And , like , they serve purposes in their culture but sometimes they do n't fit into ours .
Right .
And it 's hard to see their point of view .
Right .
I 've -- I 've talked with some people from , you know , different countries [inaudible ] and , yeah , you know , the American guy just do n't go with their values .
Uh-huh .
But it 's their culture and , like , I guess it provides them with structure in their society and --
Right .
-- with their tradition or something so --
Right .
Are you a student ?
Um , I go to college .
Mm .
Yes .
But you do n't -- so do you have -- there in California ?
Yes .
Yeah .
So do you have a lot of other international students in your classes ?
