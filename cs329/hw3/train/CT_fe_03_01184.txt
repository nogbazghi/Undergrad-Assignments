Uh , one is actually originally um , a Thailand guy .
Oh , okay .
But he actually was very interested in going initially before because he had been adopted by , uh , I think , American parents .
Oh , okay .
So , he wanted to go back and when he did , he -- he could not stop ranting about it .
So , it 's pretty good .
Yeah .
.
Just watching on , like , TV shows too , I 'm like , ooh , Thailand .
Yeah .
I 've always wanted to go .
So , you should go anyway , even if you , you know , do n't inherit lots of money .
You should just ...
When are you going ?
When ?
Yeah , when ?
[inaudible ]
You know , I mean , if you dream about it , you should live your dreams , right ?
Well , that 's true but in terms of a timeline for that , I have absolutely no idea .
Yeah .
Well ... I do n't know .
Maybe when I 'm ... before I have kids .
Well , that 's probably a good idea , yeah .
.
Yeah , probably like , my mum always tells me that , like , when she was young , she used to go , like , grab all her friends and go travel different places and I think it 's more p - possible now to do that , since everything 's closer and more global .
Yeah .
So , maybe I can convince a few people to go to Thailand .
I think you should .
You know , this uh , call could be like one of those catalysts that just change everything , right ?
Right .
You start off on one conversation and then suddenly , you discover that you really want to go to Thailand , so you should n't really think about it too much and you should just do it , right ?
Right .
Yeah .
Even if it does n't cost a million dollars ?
Ev- even if it does n't , yeah .
.
Mm ...
Oh .
So , okay , so you 've got the ... the land , the people , uh ... I mean , what would be the best -- is Bangkok , Bangkok 's in Thailand , right ?
Yes , it is .
Yeah .
So , would you go there or would you go , like , out in the country , or would you go , like , to the coast or --
' Cause there 's some really cool islands are n't there , that you could go kayaking , through ?
Oh , wow , that 's true .
Actually , I tried kayaking once and I loved it .
Yeah .
Yeah .
Have you ever kayaked on the Hudson ?
Oh , no .
No, I have n't .
Oh .
Have you ?
Yeah , that 's where I kayaked .
Oh .
It 's very unusual , since everyone , like , is -- when they think the Hudson , they 're like , oh my gosh , what a dirty river .
Well , actually , I think I saw something about -- they kind of cleaned it up a lot .
Right .
Like uh ... and they built this uh ... boat ... like Pete Seger[ ?] .
