I do n't want to spoil this for anyone so you might want to move on if you have n't it read but I 'm STILL upset about Uncle Press getting killed and I read this book two months ago !
It 's a very good book though , very entertaining .
You ca n't read this far and just stop , it 's just too good .
I 've read all the way to book six ( Rivers of Zadaa ) .
Soon as I can I 'm getting the next two .
I prefer Keys to the Kingdom series over this but this series is just as imaginative and creative
