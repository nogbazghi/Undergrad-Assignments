I use my Deni vacuum sealer all the time , and just ordered more of these "bags-on-a-roll" .
As far as I 'm concerned , they work great , and I like my Deni sealer .
Maybe one day I 'll upgrade to a better model ( I 've got the low-end ) , but it 's been working fine for me for a couple of years now .
