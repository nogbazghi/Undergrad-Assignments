Everyone knows that being tall has its benefits .
Greater social and economic prospects are two of the more
obvious ones , studies suggest .
But can a taller stature also
a longer life ?
The answer : It 's debatable .
Scientists have known
for years , for example , that as the standard of living
in a society improves , giving people greater access to nutrition ,
the average height and life span tend to go up .
Widespread malnutrition and hardships , on the other hand , have the
opposite effect .
As a result , many researchers have argued that greater height is
a reflection of better health , and in turn a longer
life .
One group of epidemiologists at the University of Bristol in England
has published studies showing that taller people , after controlling for
various factors , are less likely to die of coronary heart
disease , respiratory disease and stomach cancer than shorter people .
But others say shorter is better .
One researcher , Thomas T. Samaras ,
the author of " The Truth About Your Height , " has published
a number of studies suggesting that taller people age faster
because they consume more calories .
In one study , published in 2003 , Samaras and his co-authors argued
that even the well-known tendency for women to live longer
than men could be explained because men are on average
8 percent taller .
Which side is right is not known .
In the end , only
one relationship between size and mortality seems clear : An expanding
waistline lowers life expectancy .
THE BOTTOM LINE -- The effect of height on life span ,
if any , is unclear .
