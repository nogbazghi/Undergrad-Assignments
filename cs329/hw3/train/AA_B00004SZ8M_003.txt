Ok ...so this isnt a review ,but a question I have on this product .
Where is the instruction manual to this thing ?
What do the lines above the alcohol names mean .
There are two , three , even four lines above some of the alcohol names .
Does it mean the amount of alcohol that is supposed to be put into that particular drink .
Please answer...for it has left many of us flustered .
thank you very much
