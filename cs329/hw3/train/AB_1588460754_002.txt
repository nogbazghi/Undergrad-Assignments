The Kargatane did an excellent job , in my opinion , of releasing information in the first 3e Ravenloft book that should have been available to players .
I 'm not a HUGE canon freak , but I do like to control what information my players have ... and this work does that very well .
The " DM only " information derided by previous reviewers does belong in players ' hands , because the Van Richten 's Guides were published in Ravenloft for the common person to read .
Fear/Horror/Madness checks are logical , and with the popularity of studies of psychology in the time period represented , people would have as much of a concept of how this works as a rudimentary glance-over would allow a player to recall .<br> I
wo n't game without it , but having an autographed copy ai n't hurting my enthusiasm .
