I use a mixer pretty heavily ..bread dough a few times a week and long brioche mixing cycles , in addition to the usual cakes and cookies .
This mixer has worked pretty well , but this weekend it burned out on a batch of Massa Souada ( portugese sweet bread ) .
It went clunkity clunk and then quit turning on :-( .
I really expected to have this mixer for a long time , so I 'm a little disappointed
