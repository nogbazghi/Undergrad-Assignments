I 'm enjoying the book , but can see why some people are n't .
The style is unusual -- a lot of detail and description , but I enjoy the author 's style so much that I 'm happy with it .
None of this makes the book drag , and the humor is appropriate and not overdone .
My gripe is with the Kindle edition .
Apparently nobody at the publishing house checked how this looks on a Kindle , because it is the worst thing I 've ever seen .
What would be headers and footers in the printed book appear in the middle of the text ; it 's missing the line-breaks in between different characters ' dialogue , so it 's hard to keep track of who is talking ; at least one passage is randomly italicized ; weird line breaks appear everywhere .
Really , really irritating .
I saw these problems in formatting in the ( lovely long ) excerpt but liked the book enough to decide to soldier on and buy this edition anyway .
I 'm glad I did , but I really wanted to tell the publishers I was n't going to pay until they formatted it properly !
