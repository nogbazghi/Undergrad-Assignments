All right , Larry Birkhead , the boyfriend who claims he was with Anna for two and a half years , says he loved Anna .
He says he tried to keep her off the drugs .
He believes he` s the father of her baby , and is fighting with all of his might for a paternity test .
Why do you think that Anna ditched Larry for Howard ?
Well , a lot of people have the same problem Anna does , which is when -- it is something called self-verification theory .
It means that you verify -- you surround yourself with people who verify how you feel about yourself .
So , if you do n` t feel too good about yourself , you`re not going to want to be around somebody who loves you , and cares about you .
You want to be around people who do n` t think so highly of you if you adopt think so highly of yourself .
I think that` s what we`re seeing here .
I`ve got to tell you , it` s getting really hard to distinguish the heroes from the villains in this unbelievable story .
What about Birkhead ?
Do you see him as one of the possible heroes here ?
Oh , that` s the hope .
I mean , this is the kind of story that if we told it , people would say you`re making this up .
Yeah .
But because it` s such an outrageous story , there has to be a hero .
He seems like a very together guy .
He seems like somebody who is very lovely and loveable .
Yeah , he` s definitely the hero .
So we want him to be the father .
We`re kind of rooting for him .
I`ve talked to Larry .
He` s convinced he` s the father .
From what he tells me , it seems like he truly loved her .
I have to say , if Larry is one of the more stable , good guys out there -- God knows she could have used one of those , a stable person in her life -- why in the world -- I know you talked about this a bit -- but elaborate a bit more .
Why would she choose Howard over somebody like that ?
Because Anna Nicole was somebody who -- she likes drama .
There` s no drama with settling down with somebody wonderful and loving .
There` s no drama in that .
Her life has been tumultuous .
She does n` t understand how good stability could have been for her .
It` s a shame she never got to learn that lesson .
We`re not saying Howard was a bad guy .
We just do n` t know how it` s going to play out just yet .
These are all hypotheticals .
Before Anna Nicole died , she and Howard K. Stern had a commitment ceremony .
Howard claims they were going to get married .
You`re a developmental psychologist , from what you have seen , do you really think Anna Nicole loved Howard ?
It almost feels like -- you know , when you say to your best friend when you`re little , if we`re 30 , and we`re still single , let` s get married ?
It almost feels like that .
Because they were best friends .
They were very close .
I do n` t know about you , but I watched her show on E! all the time .
Because I` m fascinated by her .
