The Hungry Planet is most familiar for the photos of some thirty families from very different cultural traditions , each posed with a display of their week 's supply of food .
The book elaborates on this with many photos of the families at home , at work , at play , in the kitchen , at the market , in the garden .
The accompanying reading enhances the experience but is not so extensive as to interrupt the pictures which are the main attraction .
It 's a wonderful book to share with anyone but especially with youngsters who are old enough to appreciate the variety of human tastes and experiences .
