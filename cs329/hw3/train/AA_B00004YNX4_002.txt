I was very pleased to receive this as a Christmas gift from my brother and sister-in-law , particularly when I mentioned that I just needed an inexpensive mixer for my second home .
It looks nice and the fact that there is no center post on the beaters means that they are easy to clean up .
The problem though with this mixer is that it is way too powerful .
Even on the lowest setting , I have ingredients flying everywhere which necessitates a lot of extra clean up .
As a mom of two young kids , I have enough clean up to do !
I tend to do my baking with my five year old son , mostly for somehting fun to do , but I end up feeling frustrated when using this little gadget .
Do yourself a favor and buy another hand mixer !
