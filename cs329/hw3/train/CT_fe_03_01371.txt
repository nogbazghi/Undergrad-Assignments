Oh , okay .
Yeah .
' Cause my son is in his -- the seventh grade and he brings the -- well , he -- it 's not on his list .
It 's in the main list .
Oh , okay .
Yeah .
Mm .
And I 'm -- I 'm guessing that they 're all the same pretty much , from state to state .
Probably , yeah , pro-
I mean , because SARs have -- have their own website .
Yeah .
What --
Um --
Where are you , uh , located ?
Virginia .
Oh , okay , and I 'm in Texas .
Mm .
And , um , there were quite a few books on the -- on the SAR that I thought , you know , I mean , well , the school that I take my son to only goes up to the fifth grade .
Mhm .
And I would -- I was thinking , you know , Harry Potter was a little too , um too advanced for fifth grade .
Yeah , for the -- yeah .
High for --
But apparently not !
Yeah , if they have it out there .
I guess it depends on the fifth grader !
Yeah .
Well , how did you find out about this survey ?
Um , I am with Money Shopping Group for , um , secret shoppers .
Oh , okay .
I --
Yeah .
I -- I , uh , yeah , I do that too .
I do , um , right now I do the , um , um , apartments .
Uh huh .
Right now I -- I 'm doing some stores and stuff like that .
I had -- this -- I 've done this , um , and a couple of other little survey things , uh , but I live in a real rural area .
Oh , okay .
Yeah .
And so , um , a lot of the shops are too far !
Yeah .
You know , for me .
I mean , 'cause I 'm -- I 'm an hour I 'm an hour and a half south of Richmond and an hour and a half north of Rowley .
Oh .
And there 's not a whole lot in between .
And then there -- was it last week ?
I came across one but --
Mm .
-- it was that day !
And my day was booked !
Yeah .
And I -- I 've got some bank shops too and th - those were pretty good .
' Cause , you see , I 'm real close to Houston , I 'm outside of Houston .
Uh huh .
And , uh , those bank shops are pretty good 'cause they -- if you do it last minute they pay you forty five dollars a sh - a --
Mhm .

So , it 's pretty good .
I 've only been -- been doing it for , uh , uh , two months .

In , um , mid January I think it was , and then things got away from me for a month or so .
