I received this book from a dear cousin of mine during a time in my life when I was going through a rough patch .
It was hard to read at first because of my fragile emotional state--that being said however , it also helped me to read some of the stories because they opened up a side of me that had stayed hidden for a long time .
It took about 2 months , but I finally felt ready to read the whole book and it was truly wonderful .
It was an emotional roller coaster--but an inspirational one that I needed .
