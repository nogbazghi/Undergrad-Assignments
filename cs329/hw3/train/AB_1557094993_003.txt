Dr. Bucke had a personal inner experience which was very powerful and illuminating to himself ( what some call " a private revelation " ) .
In the edition I have it is described on pages 9 and 10...As the book develops he divides consciousness into simple consciousness ( the animals ) , self awareness consciousness ( human beings ) and cosmic conciousness ( very advanced human beings ) .
He tells us that the founders of our well known religions , plus various well known writers possessed cosmic conciousness , and as the world advances , more and more persons will possess it ...The book does not align itself to any particular religion .
It is more a work of philosophy and imagination .
The reduction of Christianity to just another religion is a disappointment to this reviewer .
However , it is a book of powerful experience and powerful thought .
