And that s -- that was mainly -- that Potter and -- the Harry Potter thingy --
Yeah .
By it being such a popular movie .
Yeah .
Um , that s -- that s -- that might be one of the reason why they selected that material .
Uh --
Oh , Im sure .
Because they wanted -- they want to have the kids read things that theyre interested in .
Yeah , definitely .
Which is very good because the kids wanna read things theyre interested in .
If they make them read stuff about , you know , pottery back in the sixteen hundreds , they dont give a --
They dont get into that !
-- a rats butt about pottery in the sixteen hundreds .
True .
So they have to give em things theyre interested in .
Mhm .
But the only time it creates a problem is when the parents dont agree with what theyre making the children read .
True .
But I think it s the parents , you know , th - if I went to one of my kids teachers and said ,  I dont want my child to read Harry Potter  she would definitely let me pick an alternate book .
Good .
That would nt be a problem , but --
Okay .

Um , you know , the -- the pros is , the childs getting a lotta attention .
Yeah .
Gets a lo- is getting , you know , might be getting the required , uh , materials that that person needs , but that child also misses out on --
Socialization .
-- the natural -- yeah , the socialization skills .
The natural --
Mhm .
-- bonding .
You know what Im saying ?
The childhood bo- I missed that a lot , you know , the -- that childhood bonding process , by moving around a lot .
Yeah .
You know , Im from New York and , um --
Oh , okay .
And , um , I left there when I was young and I came to the south and it was a big difference .
Um , uh , the first place I went to in the south was [inaudible] , Alabama , and it s that s -- no reflection on you or anything like that -- but it s redneck city .
Right , right .
And they own up to it , you know ?
So it s not --
Mhm .
-- Im not saying anything , you know , that they dont know or anything like that but -- they own up to it .
Um --
