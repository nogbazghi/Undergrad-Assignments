Wish I had this mixer 20 years ago .
After researching stand mixers , I bought my KitchenAid 2 years ago and absolutely love it .
It 's so easy to use and clean and well worth the price .
It 's powerful enough for all my cookie and bread dough recipes .
I do n't know how I ever made all those Christmas cookies without it ?
