When I think of late bloomers , I think of someone who has n't used their full potential for most of their life .
Most of the people profiled had success of one type or another early in life Many worked hard many years in their field to achieve the fame that they ultimately obtained later in life .
For instance , Alice Hamilton and Mother Teresa both worked in their chosen fields early in life and their dedication to their early chosen field propelled them to do great things .
In Mother Teresa 's case she was forty when she opened her Missions of Charity but it was a continuation of a life of service .
Others like Grandma Moses , who took up painting at age 76 , were profiled and were more inline with what one might define "late bloomers , " While it was an interesting book to read , it really did n't do the title justice .
