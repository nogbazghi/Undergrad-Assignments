This is my 2nd favorite Tupperware item .
I use it all the time for making gravies , scrambling eggs , making Kool Ade , Mixing pudding , and even as a liquid measuring cup .
I 've got about 5 of them in my cupboard .
O.K.
Here is how to get that darn top to go on .
Soak the top and bottom in HOT water and let them sit to heat up and become soft .
Now take them out and seal every thing up .
put it aside and let it cool .
The top has now been stretched to fit the bottom and will go on much easier in the future .
This technique works for just about all Tupperware plastic products .
One important thing to remember is NEVER use warm or hot liquid in the Quickshake because when you shake it up the top blows off (unless you are a practical joker ) .
By the way my first favorite is the Quick Chef .
