I 'm not sure this extremely thin and long hose produces enough suction to pick up any sawdust .
I was using duct tape to connect my Rigid vacuum hose directly to the output of my Bosch sander and the vacuum was so strong I had to pull the sander off the wood .
Then I purchased this hose and have been totally disappointed .
Make sure you buy a dust mask if you use this product you 'll need it .
The end fittings of the hose fit my vacuum and sander very well so I 'm considering removing them and attaching them to a standard size vacuum hose .
