In a true meeting of the repellant minds , Dick âDickâ  Cheney was interviewed by Rush Limbaugh , who invited him to attack the Democrats about Iraq .
Cheney laudably refrained from doing so for several long microseconds : âIâve got some friends on the other side of the aisle , and I donât want to question everybodyâs motives -- I do believe that a significant portion of the Democrats , including , I think , Nancy Pelosi , are adamantly opposed to the war and prepared to pack it in and come home in defeat , rather than put in place or support a policy that will lead to victory .â 
Support a policy .
But what else must they support ?
Itâs on the tip of my tongue ... âYou cannot pursue this fiction that some of them like to pursue , that they âsupport the troops ,â  but theyâre opposed to everything the troops are doing .
Thatâs just a non-sensical statement .â 
Again , supporting the troops means everything theyâre ordered to do .
Anything else is just non-sensical .
Also non-sensical : Nancy Pelosiâs attempt to mediate between Israel and Syria : âIt was a non-statement , non-sensical statement and did nât make any sense at allâ .
You know , Cheney pretends to despise Nancy Pelosi , but he reveals his true feelings when he describes a visit from her as a reward : âSheâs not entitled to make policy .
In this particular case , by going to Damascus at this stage , it serves to reinforce , if you will , and reward Bashir Assad for his bad behavior .
... This is a bad actor , and until he changes his behavior , he should not be rewarded with visits by the Speaker of the House of Representatives .â 
He just seethes with jealousy .
Nancy never rewards him with a visit .
âIâm obviously disappointed .
I think it is , in fact , bad behavior on her part .â 
I leave it as an exercise for the reader whether Cheney thinks Assadâs âbad behaviorâ  is worse than Pelosiâs âbad behavior .â 
[P.S. Incidentally , when I originally wrote this , I left out , from a perhaps misplaced sense of fairness , every instance where Limbaugh said repugnant things ( the Dâs are devoted to the concept or American defeat , the Senate Judiciary Committee is Stalinist for objecting to the illegal recess appointment of Sam Fox as ambassador to Belgium , etc ) , and Cheney merely expressed his complete agreement . ]
