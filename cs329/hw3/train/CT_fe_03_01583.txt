Yeah .
I think --
But I -- do n't you feel that the administration is telling us all , citizens --
-- to be vigilant and , um , you know --
Pr -- pr --
-- report -- report , um , unusual behavior and so forth , that makes all of us sort of , um --
Paranoid .
-- paranoid and feel like we -- we have the right or the power to , you know , racial profile ourselves , and we get these poor medical students in all this trouble and they have to , you know , transfer universities and stuff ?
Yeah .
Well , m - most of the public are stupid , so I do n't want them doing their own work .
Yeah .
I think i- --
But I -- I prefer that the police , huh --
Yeah .
-- you know , also get -- are able to do their job .
Yeah .
Do you remember that -- there 's another story about I think he , um -- this -- these white people on the airplane saw this , um , person sitting down , um , and they thought he was of Middle Eastern descent and --
Yeah .
-- he was reading -- do you remember that ?
Yeah .
Yeah .
And he was -- he was reading , you know , like , " Oh , you know , he 's reading Arabic" , and " Oh , no" , and it turned out he was , like , reading Chinese or something and he was , um , half , um , African American , half white .
Do you remember that ?
Did you --
Yeah .
Yeah .
I remember that .
Well , people are somewhat paranoid , which is to be expected .
Yeah .
You -- you --
But then -- and I also think that administration drives us to be paranoid .
Well , that 's Bush .
His administration drives everybody to be paranoid .
Yeah .
We -- we have terror alerts .
I -- I think of them more as surfing alerts .
When- whenever it 's red I do n't go surfing .
You know , and when it 's green you know , okay , gotta be careful , gotta go caution in the wind .
Right .
It 's not like it affects me or something .
You go to like , our university , oh , no , they put extra guards in the guard booth to seven o'clock and it really stuffs terrorists !
Yeah .
' Cause the t- -- the terrorists go through , ask the guard for directions before blowing themself up .
Hm .
Or killing people .
Yeah .
You know , like logically , okay , you know , this -- this makes me feel better .
When you think about it , it does n't matter .
Mhm .
Of course , you know , now we take off our shoes at the airport .
Because , I mean , they could n't catch a guy that had a bomb in his shoe .
Right , sure .
Of course , w- would you profile that guy , he looked kinda cr- -- if I saw that guy I would 've -- I would stop him 'cause he looks crazy to me .
