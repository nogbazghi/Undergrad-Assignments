Wow , you do n` t really get much more liberal than that .
I mean , unless you`re at Howard Dean` s Christmas party .
But so far , the biggest -- and I do mean big -- celebrity that has come out to support Hillary Clinton has been Liz Taylor .
Hmm .
I mean , forget " Who` s Afraid of Virginia Wolff ? " Who` s afraid of Liz Taylor ?
Liz said initially she was contributing $ 100,000 to the Clinton campaign , but it turned out to be only $ 2,300 .
I do n` t know if she blew the rest on that pretty blue eye shadow or not .
In a nutshell , by simply standing still , Hillary Clinton has managed to move much closer to the center .
While most of America does watch Oliver Stone and George Clooney movies , most do n` t share their politics .
The majority of the country is politically centrist , and the majority of Hollywood , not so much .
It` s not going to take America long to do the math and lump Senator Obama with those who support him .
Now , add in the fact that , according to some polls , Obama is n` t getting -- getting unanimous support from African-Americans , that voting bloc that many thought would be his staunchest supporters -- supporters .
In fact , " Washington Post " and ABC News just did a poll .
Black Democrats prefer his rival , Hillary Clinton , to a margin of three to one .
By managing to stay out of Hollywood` s lens and letting Obama take the liberal lead , Hillary has suddenly become the moderate Democrat candidate .
Now , I` m not saying that that` s intentional , but Hollywood could n` t have scripted that any better .
Mike Allen , he` s the chief political correspondent from Politico .
Hi , Mike .
The weather` s always great here .
I` m kind of - - how are you , Glenn ?
Very good .
How much of this do you think is coincidence ?
With Hillary Clinton , is there a -- I do n` t think so , but is there a chance ?
I mean , this is great for her .
Well , of course .
And , Glenn , if you want to talk about Academy Awards , you should have been watching , as I know you have been , Senator Clinton` s web casts each night , where we`re invited into what looks like her living room ...
Yes .
... to see how accessible and conversational she is .
She`ll tell you about her daughter .
She`ll tell you about her favorite movies .
And so , there` s Senator Clinton who` s been trying to give the softer side .
That` s insane .
With -- with Barack Obama , he` s not only getting the much more liberal people behind him , but he` s also lost the -- or has n` t gained the African-American support at this point .
How is it that the African-American community identify with Bill Clinton as the first African-American president ...
That` s right .
That` s right .
... over an actual African-American ?
Well , of course , they have n` t yet , Glenn , and , of course , everybody` s still shopping .
And it` s right that Senator Obama has not necessarily locked down the African-American vote , but I think it would be a pretty unfair assumption to just say that he would , any different than it would be to say that Senator Clinton` s automatically going to get the vote of every woman .
There` s quite a few women in my life .
I can tell you she does n` t have that vote .
