A very good addition to the home supply of pans and skillets .
There is a nice heft to the pan , it heats evenly ( though , like most relatively heavy pans , it takes a while to get up to full temperature ) , and the cooking surface is non-stick , but without the ultra-slippery "plastic " feel that some non-stick pans have .
Add to that the fact that it can go in the dishwasher , and it makes for a very good pan .
