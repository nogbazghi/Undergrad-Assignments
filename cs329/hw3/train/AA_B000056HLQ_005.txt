This humidifier is loud , the white noise could be soothing to some , but annoying for other people .
The reason I am rating this with a 2 because it leaked a HUGE puddle of water the second night I used it .
I returned this humidifier and went with theFuijitronic FB-602 Ultrasonic Humidifier with Built-in Ionizer and have n't had a single problem .
Our toddler also loves the little bear design .
