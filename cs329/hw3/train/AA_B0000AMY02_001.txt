I have purchased many humidifiers over the last 10-15 years as I have chronic sinus problems that are exacerbated by dry winter air .
As you research the ratings of these appliances - you see that ALL models from ALL brands have glaring problems in their designs .
I like the styling and feature set of the Bionaire brand - I have purchased 3 in total ... the model I liked best is no longer made - but i thought i would give these a try ----- If you have even remotely hard water and if you do n't want to be constantly replacing MOLDY wicking elements ----avoid this style of humidifier technology .
They are terrible .
And it is not Bionaire 's fault - all brands fall prey to the fundamental flaw of this approach to humidity .
A wad of paper soaking in water all day/all night .
It 's a shame because the Galileo remote hygrometer/control unit is very well thought out and the looks of these units are great .
It 's just that wicking humidifiers are fundamentally the wrong approach .
So until somebody make a wick that is impervious to both mineral deposits AND mold/mildew ... do n't waste your money .
I liked my old warm mist Bionaire and I am considering one again .
There is still a scale problem there , but it seems the least annoying of all the humidifier technologies in terms of performance , maintenance and byproducts like mold , white dust or scale .
As for Bionaire - I feel there products are well built , smartly designed , attractive , acceptably quiet , and built to last a long time .
I just do n't find the wick approach to be at all intelligent .
too bad - maybe another model .
Will let you know .
