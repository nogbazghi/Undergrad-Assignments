I have had a few Shop Vacs in my little workshp over the last 40 years .
I have been adding them , not replacing them .
They have proved to be extremely reliable ... the oldest one still doing dust collection duty for my table saw .
I just had a problem with my "newest " one , a 10 gal unit .
I emailed Shop Vac and explained the problem .
In about 1 hour they sent me a response and said they will ship a replacement part .
They stand behind their products !
