Brazil and the United States are the two largest democracies by population in our hemisphere .
Polite Canadians will simply make that mental edit and have no need to write even a mildly cross letter .
( Though they may write one regarding the stereotypical use of "eh" . )
The other thing that the United States and Brazil have in common is that they both clung to slavery far longer than any of the countries around them .
Brazil was the major destination of the African slave trade .
So this much-vaunted "democracy " was of course only for a portion of the population .
( Yes , there 's also the question of women 's suffrage happening even later , but let 's stick with one injustice at a time ) .
Slavery in Brazil actually ties in nicely with the "alternative fuel " aspect of the story ; slaves were used extensively in the cultivation of sugar cane .
And now we can come full circle , devoting agricultural crops to feeding rich people 's energy-guzzling habits , so that black people will suffer .
Ok , not all who will die of hunger as a result will be African , but quite a few will be .
