To start with the faults in the book itself , this book is missing a decent map ( like the one in the Faerun setting ) and is not particularly well structured .
<br>Otherwise , I have no experience with 2nd Ed Ravenloft , but I 've read the novels and this book certainly captures the mood ... not surprising , since it 's written by the Kargatane , Ravenloft 's lifeline and now , possibly , its saviors .
The information is generally clear and useful , and the real meaning of a Gothic campaign is well described .
So why only three stars ?<br>It 's the price that drives it up .
You can make characters with this book , but the DM must have the " Secrets of the Dread Realm " expansion ( which should have been bigger and more complete with more darkords , and should have carried most of the DM-only information in this book , like Dread Companions , Power checks , monster stats etc. ) and should have " Denizens of Darkness " to run a good campaign , which works out to a lot of money when you add the D&D rulebooks .<br>All in all , this book is very good in itself , but it holds information it should n't ( DM-only ) and is brought down by its supplements .
If " Secrets " had been more complete and this book had had maybe two or three prestige classes , I would have easily given it 5 stars regardless of the lack of a map .
