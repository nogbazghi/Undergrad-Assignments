I 've had this for about 4 years , and recently it started leaking water all over the floor .
I had read a review about positioning the tank correctly , but I could n't see how it was positioned wrong so it would leak .
Plus I 'd never had this problem in all the prior years of usage .
Like other reviewers , I was n't happy about the cost of the filters or the constant need to replace them .
Also not going to risk a third leakage and wet floor by using again .
Currently shopping for a new one .
