I first discovered Analon Titanium ( restaurant tested ) fry pans in Macy 's .
They only had an 8 inch model , which I purchased as it is perfect for making a personal omelet .
They are heavy gauge aluminum clad in titanium on the bottom and have completely steel handles unlike the lower grade of Analon which look very similar but have silicone rubber handle grips .
As such , the metal handles are much better for popping a meal into the oven after initially frying/browning it on the stove .
The nonstick coating is very high grade as well .
