I did -- I -- I did take like four years in High School --
Yeah , yeah .
-- but , you know , ca n't remember it that well .
It 's not like that in Western Washington where I 'm at , but in , um , Eastern Washington I 'm -- my phone sounds so funny .
In Eastern Washington there 's a lot of , uh , farming communities and a lot of -- oh , I 'd say a lot of the population over there are migrant workers from California --
Yeah , well --
-- you know , Mexican and --
We 're about --
-- from Mexico .
-- we 're about five minutes from the boarder anyway .
Yeah , that 's true .
So , I mean , that 's --
Yeah .
-- the big thing .
I mean , we live almost the fartherest South that you can go --
Mhm .
-- but even my grandmother who lives up near San Luis Obispo , California which is --
Oh , that 's beautiful , yeah .
-- about , you know , almost the most north you can go in what they consider Southern California --
Right .
-- there 's still a lot of people that speak Spanish .
I mean , she runs into probably about ten percent of the people though that speak Spanish --
Mhm .
-- but compared to where I 'm from , where you know , half of a percent --
Yeah .
-- you know , I mean --
Yeah .
-- speak Spanish .
It 's -- it 's a big difference .
Oh , it must be kind of -- I -- I 've never lived in a -- in California , so -- but I 've heard that .
I 've heard , you know , and it -- all the signs are in Spanish and --
Oh , well it 's not so much that --
-- everything is --
-- I mean , there 's a couple of billboards that my husband are like , " We 're in America , why are they in Spanish ? "
Yeah .
You know , I mean , we can understand that 's catering to them .
They -- they have --
Yeah .
-- yes , they have to learn the language but it gets to be monotonous when you 're driving around and you 're like , " Why am I reading something in Spanish ? "
Exactly , yeah .
You know , or that 's only in Spanish .
It 's not like , you know , it says , " Hello " and then says , " Hello " in Spanish , you know --
Right .
-- it 's -- it 's just the whole thing in Spanish and you 're thinking , " Huh " --
Yeah , we 're --
But it 's just kind of so - --
-- American and you need to learn to speak English , yeah .
It 's kind of different , but I do n't know --
But we 've -- we 've only been out here for a while --
Mhm .
-- so , we 're only gonna be out here for , hopefully , another like two , three years .
