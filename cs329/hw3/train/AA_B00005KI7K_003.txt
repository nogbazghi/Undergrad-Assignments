I purchased this a while back and waited patiently for months to get it because it was on backorder .
Spatulas are probably one of my most used items in the kitchen because I bake so much .
This one is a winner .
It goes great with my Kitchenaid Pro 600 mixer .
The long handle gets to the bottom of the huge bowl easily .
The only thing that might knock it down a half star is that the handle leaks water .
I stopped putting it in the dishwasher and it never leaks now , but just something to think about .
I like the feel of the kinda weighted handle on it though .
Worth the wait for me !
