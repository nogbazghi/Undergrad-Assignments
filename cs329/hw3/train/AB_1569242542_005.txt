I was lucky enough to take this author 's class with my son in KC.
After a few months of signing to him , he began signing nonstop around age 11 months .
It helped immensely to reduce his frustration ( and mine ! ) in communicating his needs and wants .
He learned new signs quickly and his vocabulary/recognition of new objects grew immensely in the months to follow .
Now that he is 2 , his verbal skills are highly advanced ( he speaks very clearly and can compose complex sentences ) , and I firmly believe this is due to the strong language base he started with the signing programs .
The songs and games in this book are still some of his favorites !
Glad to see this great resource is available to parents everywhere !
Thanks Anne !
