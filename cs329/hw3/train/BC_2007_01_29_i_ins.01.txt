But there have been , certainly , in Mato Gross , there 's been shown to be a reasonably strong link between deforestation and soy farming .
You are trying , your organization is trying to limit it with a kind of 1/5-4/5 program .
Farmers who own land are encouraged and allowed to use 1/5 of it for soybean farming while reserving 4/5 of it as rainforest .
Have I got that right ?
And more importantly , is it working ?
Is it working in a significant way ?
The Brazilian forest code is quite specific about the legal obligations of agricultural producers , and in the Amazon , they 're obliged to maintain 80 percent of their land holding in native vegetation or native forest , if you like .
If they do n't have that 80 percent , then they 're meant to acquire areas that will bring them up to that 80 percent threshold .
So the work that we 're doing with Cargill and the general message we spread to other countries , is that they need to be compliant with Brazilian environmental legislation .
It would not be acceptable in the United States to be buying soy from producers who were not compliant with U.S. environmental legislation .
I 'm going to interrupt you , though , because the legal obligation is one thing .
There are vast areas of the Amazon that are lawless .
How are you doing ?
Is it really working ?
It 's precisely because of the lawlessness of the Amazon that we find ourselves talking to companies like Cargill .
You know , the Amazon is increasingly being pulled into world markets , and the fact of the matter is , is that if you 're having goods produced for export to places like Europe , where consumers are worried about the environmental implications of what they 're consuming , and if you have to present the presence of companies , like Cargill , who are actually rather sensitive to problem for their image that events in the Amazon can cause , then you have new pressure points that environmental groups like ourselves can take advantage of .
And I think , you know , we can work with the companies to try and encourage them to only source from producers who are compliant with the actually rather good Brazilian environmental legislation .
And yet , forgive me for interrupting , Cargill is saying that it is refusing to buy soybeans off land that was illegally cleared before July 2006 .
Essentially what they 're saying is ...
Yes , that 's a moratorium on further cultivation , which is something we 've been trying to get Cargill to agree to for a number of years .
That 's forward looking , and probably important , but is n't it essentially allowing anyone who has already broken the law , anyone who has already violated the environment , to get rich ?
And saying that we will not allow anyone else to do this perhaps for the next two years , but everyone who has already done it , we 'll buy plenty of soybeans if you can grow them .
I think that there 's a great deal -- in the Amazon , there is a large number of land that 's already been cleared a long time ago .
There 's plenty of opportunity for grain producers to grow grain on land that was cleared , you know , 15 , 20 , 30 years ago .
