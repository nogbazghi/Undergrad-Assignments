I love the versatility this set gives me .
I can hook it up , with an adapter , to my dust-collection system and keep all the sawdust out of my way when I 'm working with a tool having a 2-1/2 dust port .
Then I can hook it up to my shopvac and clean up the whole shop from floor to ceiling .
I ca n't think of a way to improve this set , it has everything you need and want .
