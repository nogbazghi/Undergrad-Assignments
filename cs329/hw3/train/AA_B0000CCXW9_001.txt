In my handyman business , a small powerfull vac is a must .
I 've had several Dirt Devils , tried Oreck 's Power Brush , and sent it back , because it , like the Dirt Devil handhelds are toys ; their motors are wimpy .
After trying the Vac n' Blo , I finally found a vac that is n't a toy , yet it 's so quiet , you do n't think it 's going to have good suction , but it does - enough to run the optional power rug brush , which the Dirt Devil could n't do without a belt powered by the motor .
Why less than perfect ?
No attachment storage , and wheels would help , but they make you pay extra for that .
But in the end , if you want a compact vac that 's not a wimp , this baby is for you .
