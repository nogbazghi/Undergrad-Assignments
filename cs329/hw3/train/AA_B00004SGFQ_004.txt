There 's about 3 different thing happening that does n't allow this to work .
First , the plunger does n't create a seal while trying to push ground meat down the feeder .
It works well for grinding cubes of meat but ground meat oozes up the sides of the plunger when trying to push meat down .
This creates a great seal when you 're trying to pull the plunger back out and now you have a vacuum which sucks any meat in the worm back out .
Second , the worm does n't create a good seal pushing food to the sausage funnel so you ca n't drop ground meat down the chute and expect it to come out the stuffer .
Once again great for grinding meat but not for pushing ground meat through .
Third , when you finally get meat through you 'll get big pockets of air in your casing that made their way through the worm due to the suction problems mentioned in problem # 1 above .
If you want the most frustrating experience every with your mixer you can try this .
It is cheap but I 'm investing in a real sausage stuffer that allows me to enjoy the full process of making sausage and not finish by being throughly frustrated during the last step .
