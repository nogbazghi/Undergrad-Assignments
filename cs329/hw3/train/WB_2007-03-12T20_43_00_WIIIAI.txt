In an interview with the Chicago Tribune ( whose website , by the way , has a short audio clip which is misquoted several times in the article ; makes you wonder about the accuracy of newspaper interviews generally ) , the alliterative asshole Peter Pace complains about Al Qaida and Taliban members using Pakistan as a safe haven for their operations in Afghanistan : âIt is proper for us to point out to President Musharraf that people are continuing to come across the border .â 
Speaking of not liking people continuing to âcome across the border , â  if you know what I mean , Pace also strongly supported the continuance of the Donât Ask , Donât Tell policy , repeatedly using the word âimmoral , â  as in , â I believe homosexual acts between individuals are immoral and that we should not condone immoral acts â .
Which is of course a misrepresentation of the policy , as was his comparing it with the military prohibition on adultery with the spouse of another member of the military .
He also attributed his position to his âupbringing , â  as if the source of his personal homophobic bigotry had any relevance to... oh , honestly , enough .
Also... âhomosexual acts between individualsâ ?
Would he be happier with group orgies ?
Bush was in Guatemala today , and held a press conference with President Oscar Berger .
Again , the translation in the transcript is not that good , as it has Berger saying âthank you for your visit .
Guatemala feels honored .â 
That just canât be right .
He observed a program with a US Navy medical ship .
âThe American people would have been incredibly proud of watching our military folks dispense with basic health care needs to people who needed help .â 
Sounds like Walter Reed .
Dispense with basic health care needs , indeed .
âImagine not being able to see , and then all of a sudden somebody appears in your life , gives you an eye test and fits you for glasses so you can see better .â 
Imagine if the first thing you see is George Bush .
In the village of Chirijuy , they made him do the first useful work heâs done in his entire life : âAs a matter of fact , I got to pack some lettuce .
The President and I were hauling boxes of lettuce , we were putting them in the truck .â 
Scab .
A lot of the concern in Guatemala is about American immigration policy and some recent raids that resulted in Guatemalans being seized and deported .
And Bush referred to... well , I donât actually know : â He also mentioned to me that thereâs some conspiracies about how children are being left behind in Guatemala .
No es la verdad .
Thatâs not the way America operates .â 
He was asked about the Salvadoran members of the Central American Parliament killed in Guatemala : âAs to the Salvadorians [sic] , of course , Iâm deeply concerned about their death , as is the President .
And we have sent , I think , four FBI agents down here to help with forensics and to help track down the leads , so that wherever those killers may light , the authorities can go get them .
And that âs what we need to do . â 
Or would need to do , if the killers hadnât been caught and killed in their prison cells last month .
He praised Guatemalaâs democracy , but sadly no one took opportunity of what I believe is the first visit by a sitting US president since the â54 coup to ask him to apologize for the CIAâs role in it .
Nor did anyone ask him about the Mayan site that will be cleansed of evil spirits after his visit .
Reporters .
Feh .
