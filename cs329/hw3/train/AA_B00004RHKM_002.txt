For the reviewers that complained that they needed to go back to the vac to manually turn off the unit when using the "on-demand " feature , you need to return the unit to be repaired .
My vac works perfectly when using the on demand feature .
It has a delay of about 6 or 7 seconds before shutting off .
This delay is a built in feature that allows the hose to clear itself before shutting down .
I think most of the problems mentioned in the reviews have come from not reading the instructions ( I must admit , I 'm guilty of this myself from time to time ) .
As far as clogging , all vacs with and 1 1/2 " hose will clog from wood chips .
I invested in the larger hoses that amazon offers , and they fit perfectly into the vac intake .
As far as the tool end connection to the hose , this is where good old yankee ingenuity will help .
There are rubber fittings available that are " stepped " in size to accomadate different diameter connections , this item does n't work on all connections , but most .
I did have to have the on-demand switch replaced after about 9 months of use ( reason for the 4 stars ) , but other than that this vac has performed extremely well .
My main use of the vac is dust collection while being attached to my Bosch orbital sander .
It picks up about 95 % of the dust , which is a huge improvement over using the attached cloth bags that come with some sanders .
I have several of my shop power tools pre-fitted with vac hoses , and simply wheel the vac from tool to tool when needed .
This vac is a great alternative to investing in a dust collection system , and all that goes with it , when you do n't have the room or the budget .
