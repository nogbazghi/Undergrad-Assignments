I loved the tray that came with my Nesco Dehydrator so much ; I had to have four more !
I buy a lot of fruit for my kids to eat , and I used to throw away a lot of fruit that would over ripen before they could eat it all (especially bananas ) .
Once I got my dehydrator , I started making Fruit Leathers with the leftovers .
my kids actually preferred it to the fresh fruit !
All I do is remove the peel from any fruit that is past its peak , throw it in the food processor , liquefy it , scoop it onto the Clean-A-Screen Tray and place it in the dehydrator .
When it is dry I take the tray out- and give it to my kids to peel and place in airtight bags - they usually eat it all and never put any in bags !
I have even used it as " treat when you finish your homework ! "
Can you believe that - they are eating fruit with no sugar added and think it is a special treat !
AWESOME! ! ! !
