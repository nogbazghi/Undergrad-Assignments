Yeah .
Like , I think some schools banned that because , you know , they felt like there were some violent outbreaks or whatever at -- at certain schools related to that , um , so I mean , yeah .
Like , I -- you know , it 's easy to say you 're , ah , you can just have an open society and stuff like that , but then when you have books that , you know , that instruct people how to make bombs or --
Yeah .
-- you know , things like that , you have to draw a line somewhere , too .
Um , which is , you know , more of a general censorship kind of thing than just in schools and what students should be allowed to read , so ...
I mean , in an ideal world there should be free speech whatsoever , but --
R- -- yeah .
But considering we 're not perfect human beings , there should be restrictions .
Yeah .
I -- I 'm just curious as to how , uh , how it 's decided , you know , in communities what books are able to be read by students and which ones are n't , or which , you know , are on the reading lists of assigned books if you -- if you have a summer off --
Yeah .
-- you know , what -- what books make it on the summer reading list ... um , you know , if it is in fact a community kind of decision , you know , like in Kentucky or wherever , you 're talking about , you know , if the members of whatever committee , and I guess it 's a committee , you know , that decides this kind of decision .
Maybe it 's just , you know , the superintendent of schools , I really do n't know , um , you know , how are the people who make that decision elected or , you know , appointed or whatever and it probably varies from place to place .
I also think there should be options available .
I mean , if you are objecting to a certain book , then you should be able to read another book of equal literary merit .
Mhm .
But I do n't know how practical that is , considering public education and its current status .
Yeah .
I mean , yeah , of course , and just the availability of books probably .
Yeah .
So , mm .
Yeah , if you -- if you make , uh , every book or s - several books available , you 're going to have to buy , you know , a different copy , many copies of different books .
Mhm .
So ... mm .
I mean , I get into arguments like this all the time , like free speech , flag burning --
Ahah .
-- like the Nazi parade --
Ahah .
-- stuff like that .
You get what , email ?
No, I get like arguments --
Oh , arguments .
-- with , like , random people .
Oh . Really ?
Yeah .
Oh , okay .
Um , I do n't really , uh , get into arguments about it with people , but I guess I 'm not , uh , that -- that vocal about things either .
I mean , you know , I do n't -- I do n't think like the -- the KKK should have , you know , like free speech rights or anything , um , --
