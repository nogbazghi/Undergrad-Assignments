John Cunniff , the former Boston College star and Bruins assistant coach ,
died of cancer less than 90 days after assisting Herb
Brooks behind the Team USA bench at the 2002 Olympic
Games at Salt Lake City .
Joe Barrett , an old friend of the Cunniff family from their
Southie days , would like to have Cunniff memorialized by having
the Beanpot 's MVP award named in his honor .
" I ca n't believe anyone would be more deserving , " said the 45-year-old
Barrett , a special agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration , "especially
in this era when it seems every award is named
after someone .
He was the first to win it twice
[1964 , '65] , and the kids he helped to get in
the game , the kids he helped improve their game ...
" I 'd just love to see it happen . "
Steve Nazro , the tournament 's longtime director , said the Beanpot committee , comprising
Nazro and the four schools ' athletic directors , would be open
to considering such a motion .
Barrett , said Nazro , need only
write a letter to the committee .
This year 's Beanpot will
be held Feb.
6 and 13 at the Garden , and
the committee is scheduled to meet again in April or
May .
Cunniff , who would have turned 62 this year , became a career
coach after a brief playing career with New England and
Quebec in the WHA .
