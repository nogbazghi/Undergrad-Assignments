I would rate this a " 0" , but it was n't an option available .
I never got a decent batch of ice cream out of this product .
Just a soupy mush .
Tried multiple different recipes and even ran 2 separate trials with this machine next to my original ,very tired Oster machine .
The worn out machine made a great batch , this one , zilch .
