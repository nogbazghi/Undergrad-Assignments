Right .
-- they can change whether they want to or whether they can , it 's the same thing , with , um , with professional , um , athletes of what they get paid compared --
Mhm .
-- to what people get paid in the entertainment industry --
Mhm .
-- and the bulk of it is -- is just unbelievable amounts of money in comparison to what they expect people to live in , you know , on a minimum wage .
Right .
You know , which is , you know , not nearly possible on today 's salaries that are n't minimum wage --
Mhm .
-- are n't any different to what think were ten , fifteen years ago and I think it 's the same thing when somebody gets in front of a TV or , ah , goes to a movie theatre and sits there and they do n't look at the -- the movie of a television show and say " Hey , look at that actor --"
Mhm .
"-- you know , they are getting paid X amount of millions of dollars for doing this" , I do n't even think the thought goes through their minds .
That 's -- that 's --
They 're aware of it .
That 's a valid point .
I never thought of it li- you know , because you want to go see Julia Roberts maybe even though she is getting twenty million per movie they are probably , you know , making more than -- than some of the athletes , that is a good point .
But --
What -- what burdens me is when they build a new stadium and then they -- like in Denver they built a new stadium and then they tax people .
I do n't even live in the Denver county and we have to pay taxes on the stupid new stadium that -- you know , I 'm from California , I do n't even care about these Denver teams , you know so that 's how that , you know , that kind of thing drives me crazy when you do n't even think you 'll , you know , be participating and what is going to go on in that stadium and you are getting taxed for it , I do n't agree with that because these are definitely private teams , it 's not a public Olympic type thing or , you know , I do n't know .
And then whose name is on it ?
Right .
You know , it 's not -- you know , it 's not Denver stadium .
Right , exactly .
You know , if it was , you know , city , county , some type of government you would -- you would think otherwise --
Mhm .
-- so , you know , who is paying for the stadium and the salaries they are getting paid to play in there .
Mhm .
And then they want the people to pay for where they are playing at inclusive with the salaries that they are receiving --
Yes .
-- and the salary that you are receiving is n't even close to it .
