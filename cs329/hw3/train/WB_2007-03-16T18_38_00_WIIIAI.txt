Bush , at a âshamrock ceremonyâ  with Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern , proved that he speaks Irish just as well as he speaks Spanish : âgood morning --or should I say , âtop oâ  the morning .ââ 

Way too happy about getting a bowl of weeds shamrocks .
In Britain , the coroner in the â  Weâre going to jail , dude â  case , in which American planes fired on a British convoy in Iraq , has ruled that the pilots acted unlawfully by disregarding their rules of engagement .
Israeli Prime Minister Olmertâs office sent a letter to the editor of the house organ of an Arab political party , saying , âThe Shin Bet security service will thwart the activity of any group or individual seeking to harm the Jewish and democratic character of the State of Israel , even if such activity is sanctioned by the law , â  with the âforce of the principle of a democracy that defends itself .â 
I assume that âs a misprint and they intended to say âthe farce of the principle of a democracyâ .
