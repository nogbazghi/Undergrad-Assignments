Let me -- let me change gears on another story that has me confused .
And that is Anna Nicole Smith .
There was a -- there` s a web site that I saw -- and this is what -- I` m not -- I kind of lost the Anna Nicole Smith story when she was fat and then skinny and then doped up and then had a baby .
I do n` t know what` s going on and who the people are in her life .
But there was this web site that I saw that is actually showing a picture of the guy and , as a kid , and then the baby .
And he` s saying , " Hey , looks like me as a kid .
Anna Nicole Smith` s baby is mine . "
And what is this story ?
Because there` s now a paternity test that she has to go through ?
Well , Larry Birkhead , a celebrity photographer who did have an romantic relationship with her ...
Come on .
Well , a sexual relationship with her .
Thank you .
We are talking Anna Nicole Smith , please .
Claims that he` s the father .
Wants to see his daughter .
A judge has ordered DNA tests , which has to be done by January 23 .
And Larry Birkhead` s lawyers says we`re going to make it easy for her .
We`re just going to come to her door .
All she has to do is answer the door in her bathrobe .
Now , that sounds like it could be pretty hard for her , but nonetheless , supposed to be done by January 23 .
And I guess we`ll find out who the DNA will say .
She says that it` s not his .
She said it` s somebody else , right ?
She says it` s her lawyer/boyfriend Howard K. Stern .
But those baby pictures on Larry Birkhead` s web site , LarryBirkhead .net , do suggest that there` s some similarity .
Maybe a lot of babies look the same .
I do n` t know .
What would -- what would his motivation be to claim that it` s his child if it was n`t ?
Is there money to be gained from her ? Or...
You know , I do n` t think -- I think there` s money to be spent .
Because if he is the father , he` s going to be paying child support .
He` s going to be a father to the daughter .
I think he wants to be this girl` s father .
OK .
Great .
Lloyd , thank you very much .
We`ll be back with " The Real Story " in just a second .
All right , welcome to the " Real Story . "
If you had n` t heard yet , Oprah Winfrey has just cut the ribbon on a brand-new $ 40 million school for girls in South Africa , and she funded the entire project herself .
To put that in perspective , that is close to five whole months of her annual salary .
Now , to get into the school , you`ve got to meet some very strict age and income criteria .
But most importantly , you have to demonstrate both academic and leadership potential .
But that did n` t stop people from applying .
The tiny school has received over 3,500 applications ; 4 percent were accepted .
To put that into perspective , Yale University accepts 13 percent .
