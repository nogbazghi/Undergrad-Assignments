I 'm glad I spent the money for this book .
Bioenergy testing facilities seem to be scarce hereabouts .
It is some help that Schallenberger 's supplement regimen lists the ingredients .
I still have the impression that type 2 is not a disease but merely a condition that results from vitamin/mineral shortages plus too many calories and too little exercise .
