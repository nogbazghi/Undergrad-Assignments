I 'm not sure that the "5-star reviewers " actually ordered this item .
When compared to the original filter which came with the unit , it is MUCH thinner and flimsy .
Also , there is NO way to get two filters out of this .
It is too small .
after cutting out one , there is less than 1/2 of the sized needed to make another .
Do yourself a favor and order an original carbon pre-filter .
I 'm tossing this one and looking for the reall thing .
