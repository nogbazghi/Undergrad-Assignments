This book provides an excellent by-the-numbers overview of Operation Overlord .
Plenty of background on the various aspects of missions , equipment , the terrain , and the troops .
There is a startling amount of information packed into this pleasantly easy to read book .
I especially enjoy the way hard facts ( for example the number of guns on a beach ) are interspersed with interesting vignettes ( the fascine tank that became part of the bridge ) .
Strongly recommend this book .
