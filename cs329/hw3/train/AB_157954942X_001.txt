This is the first really good book on the subject that I have seen which supplies both a disease based guide and a supplement by supplement guide as well .
The author has made it easy to use for patients as well as heath care providers .
We keep a cpoy in our physician office waiting room for patient reference .
A true must for anyone interested in alternative health care options .
