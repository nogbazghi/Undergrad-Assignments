" The Tsunami Quilt " is a touching story for old and young alike .
While the tragedy of the 1946 Hawai'i tsunami is described , the story ( for me , anyway ) is mainly about the love shared between a grandfather and his grandson .
This would be a perfect read for anyone who suffers from tragedy of any kind .
It is a reminder that while life goes on , honoring the memory of a lost loved one helps us cope and heal .
