Sadly I did n't read all the reviews first , just looked at the rating .
This company is not shipping what is advertised .
They are sending out generic filters that are n't even HEPA compliant .
They are n't even Hoover , there is no brand name on them , no patent numbers ( they may be even using patents illegally ) .
That said they are filters , even if they are far thinner than the brand name ones , and you can see right through them .
Just do n't expect them to do a great job stopping dust and mites .
