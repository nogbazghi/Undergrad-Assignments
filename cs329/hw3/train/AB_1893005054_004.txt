I first came across this book under its previous title " Mayo Clinic on Healthy Weight " several years ago .
It 's marvelous food pyramid is based on energy or calorie density .
This idea was the main ingredient on my path to losing 80 pounds and restoring my blood sugar level to normal following my diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes .
An additional good idea is to apply the energy density principle to your plate by filling it with 50 % non-starchy vegetables , 25 % dense carbs and 25 % protein .
Another thing that I do is to use 50 % Kellogg 's All Bran or General Mill 's Fiber One for my breakfast cereal .
Energy density is particularly important to your selection of dessert .
A half cup of pudding made with nonfat milk and sugar free mix is less than 100 calories .
It is equally filling to a large chocolate chip muffin which comes in at 600 calories .
Other useful books on energy density are the " Volumetic " series by Barbara Rolls , the " Fit or Fat Target Diet " books by Covert Bailey and Ronda Gates , and " The GI Diet " by Rick Gallop .
