Wow what a mammoth with over 1000 pages with very little information in it .
This book has so many categories that it does n't have much information on any 1 thing .
I was so excited to get this book I was hoping that it would have information on how to build different things needed around the farm and how to care for animals yet when I started reading it I found the information lacking for my uses and refereance All this book does is collect dust on my shelf .
