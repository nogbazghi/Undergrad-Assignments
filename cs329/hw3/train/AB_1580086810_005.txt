An through and interesting way to present the food of different cultures .
The book not only shows a picture of what a week 's worth of food looks like across the globe , but puts how much it costs and in USD.
The book also elaborates on the eating habits , culture , and daily life of the people .
There are also recipes !
A great book with an eye opening perspective of people all over the world .
