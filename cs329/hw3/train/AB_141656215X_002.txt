Zapped is a huge let down .
I was looking forward to this latest installment .
It is a very quick read , but there are very few suprises here .
One of the story lines revolves around getting very personal letters back that have n't been mailed yet .
The person is afraid someone would open them .
That is completely illegal and most people know this .
To base a major part of the story on this premise is hardly believable .
What a total disappointment !
