We 've had this for a couple of months .
It is very powerful , quiet , and light weight .
However , compared to our last vacuum , a Kenmore canister , I see a few ways the Kenmore was easier to use .
First , with the Kenmore , the hose could rotate 360 degrees where it attaches to the canister .
With the Miele , the power cord gets wrapped around the hose , so if you rotated too much it binds , and puts stress on the cord .
Second , the Kenmore power button is on the handle , but with the Miele you have to go back to the canister .
This is awkward if you want to shut down the vac quickly .
Given that this one cost twice what we paid for the Kenmore , it better last at least twice as long-- we got about 6 years out of the Kenmore .
