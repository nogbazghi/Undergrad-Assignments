Six women who are senior bankers at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein Services
have sued the investment bank , contending that they were denied
equal bonuses and promotions that went to men with less
experience .
The complaint , brought by three directors and three vice presidents --
all still working at the bank -- also cites instances
of lewd behavior toward the women , entertainment of clients at
a strip club and repeated examples of scaled-back opportunities for
women after they returned from maternity leave .
In one case , Katherine Smith , a director in equity sales trading
in London who has worked at the bank or at
its predecessors since 1996 , was referred to as the " Pamela
Anderson of sales/trading " by her supervisor , according to the lawsuit .
And while Smith has been among the group 's top producers
in terms of commissions generated for stock sales , she was
awarded progressively lower bonuses and denied a promotion to managing
director , the most senior ranking on Wall Street , "because she
is a woman and because she has a child , " the
suit contends .
One woman complained of a male managing director who routinely brought
prostitutes to the office during his lunch hour , according to
the lawsuit .
The lawsuit , which was filed Monday in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan , seeks class-action status on behalf of 500 women who
work at Dresdner Kleinwort , the American investment bank of Dresdner
Bank of Germany .
The lawsuit seeks $ 1.4 billion for economic
damages , emotional distress , harm to reputation and punitive damages .
An employee of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in London , who asked to
be identified only as a spokeswoman , disputed the claims and
said the bank would fight the suit .
" It is not our policy to comment on pending or threatened
litigation , " she said .
Dresdner Kleinwort "fully complies with all applicable
employment-related laws and is confident that any claims to the
contrary are without merit , " she said .
