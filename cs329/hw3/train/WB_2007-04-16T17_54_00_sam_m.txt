I never understand why this "if we do n't defeat the terrorists in Iraq they 'll follow us here " idea appears unchallenged in the US Press ? ?
Does no one ever ask Dubyah if he thinks the Badr Brigade are going to appear in a seaborne assault on Coney Island ? ?
Does no one ever point out that "terrorists " do n't have to divert to Iraq to attack the USA , they could always go direct? ?
That his statement is devoid of logic ? ?
