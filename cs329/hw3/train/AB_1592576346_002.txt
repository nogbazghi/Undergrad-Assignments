Last semester , I had the bad luck to get stuck in a statistics class taught by a nice , but thoroughly incompetent , professor .
I seriously believed I was going to either have to drop the class or risk failing it , because nothing that was taught to us made any sense ( and our textbook was an abysmal failure too ) .
In desperation I sought out alternative sources of information , and came across this book .
It managed to transform the disastrous notes I had into something coherent .
I relied heavily on this book over the instruction and text , and managed to achieve an " A" in a class that was otherwise doomed to a " C" at best .
The book unfortunately does n't cover 2-way ANOVA or non-parametric testing , but if the author ( hint hint ) were to write a follow-up stat book covering more advanced topics , you can be sure I 'd purchase it .
