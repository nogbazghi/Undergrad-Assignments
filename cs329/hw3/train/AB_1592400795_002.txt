I found this book in the dollar store over the past weekend .
I 've read through the book and found it enjoyable : Common-sense approaches to business that can be distilled in a few easy lessons .
The chapters are short , the points of which are illustrated by vignettes peppered with familiar entertainment industry names .
It comes down to this : Be true to yourself , work hard , treat people the way you 'd want to be treated , and do n't underestimate your enemy .
Overall , a worthwhile and entertaining reading experience .
