The filters for the Oxygen vacuum seem to do the job , it 's just that the Oxygen vacuum is the worst vacuum I have every used or purchased .
I can not get the various attachments on or off the wands , then the heads make the wands fall apart about 10-20 times per room - get me some duct tape please ! ! !
I needed something lighter weight and this does meet that standard and vacuum needed allergy filtration system and it does have that .
It is so falling apart inefficient and picks up almost nothing - the flooring head is too wide and long for the suction range and physically just moves the dirt around on the floor .
I could not recommend the vacuum to anyone ...the washable filters seem to do just fine , but since the vacuum picks up nearly nothing - I may just have a lifetime supply on my storage shelf and only purchased 2. Now after a year of trying to use the vacuum it sits in the storage closet most of the time and I make do without it .
