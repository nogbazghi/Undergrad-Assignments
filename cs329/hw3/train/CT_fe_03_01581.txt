I -- I really do n't know .
And I wondered about that because I 'm sure that , you know , it -- it does help some , but a lot of people ...
Well , it does -- it does help too because , you know , you do n't know if , you know , uh --
Yeah .
-- terrorist going through the airports .
But you have to open your trunk and everything .
Yeah .
Yeah .
I mean , you do n't know if -- you know , because of all this , uh , high security checking on this .
Mhm .
And , uh -- because of terrorism and all this and , I mean , that 's why they 're doing it , and then to see if -- if there 's terrorists back into the airports and all that .
So , I mean , in a way i- it 's good that 's they 're doing it , in a way it 's not , you know , because it does --
Yeah .
They --
-- invade privacy too at the same time , you know ?
They also have random checks .
Oh , they do ?
They did that both -- both times I was flying .
Uh-huh .
Um , and I do n't know if it 's , like , every fifth person or what .
Oh , really ?
But they 'll pull somebody out and they 'll look in their suitca - or their carry on bags --
Uh-huh .
-- and they 'll check their shoes and everything , and it was kind of strange because there was no -- no way to tell --
Mhm .
-- what kinda people they were pulling out .
Yeah .
I mean , like , most of them that I saw were , like , grandmothers .
Oh , really ?
And so people get offended , they get real offended by stuff like that , you know ?
And that 's --
They think that they 're invading their privacy or , you know ... ?
That 's the reason that I think it 's , you know , every certain number .
Uh-huh .
Because whenever I landed in , um -- oh , I ca n't remember where I -- Saint Louis I think is where I --
Mhm .
-- had to change planes , uh , and they called the -- the flight was delayed for a lot of reasons .
And then when they --
Oh , really ?
-- finally did call for the flight --
Mhm .
-- a lady and I stood up at the same time and she said , " Oh , go ahead " and so I got in line in front of her .
Well , they pulled her out .
Oh , no!
So ...
That 's embarrassing .
I mean , I -- I -- she probably was embarrassed .
I -- I know I would 've if it would 've been me .
I think -- I think it 's just , you know , a random number that they --
Uh-huh .
-- they pull out every --
Certain person .
Yeah .
Every so and so person .
Yeah .
