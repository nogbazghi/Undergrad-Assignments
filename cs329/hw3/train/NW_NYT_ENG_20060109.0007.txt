Duke Energy is near a deal to sell part of its
power generation operation in North America for about $ 1.5 billion
to LS Power Group , an investment firm that specializes in
the energy sector , according to executives involved in the deal .
The transaction is expected to be announced as early as Monday ,
the executives said .
The sale includes plants in the Northeast and West that have
about 6,100 megawatts of generating capacity fueled by natural gas .
Duke announced its intention to sell the plants as well
as its portfolio of derivative contracts in September .
A spokesman for Duke , which is based in Charlotte , N.C. , confirmed
Sunday night that the company had been looking for a
buyer but declined to comment further .
A spokesman for LS
Power could not be reached .
The transaction is the most recent in a string of energy-related
deals in recent months , following Duke 's own $ 8.5 billion acquisition
of the Cinergy Corp. announced last May .
Last month , the
FPL Group , Florida 's largest utility owner , agreed to buy Constellation
Energy for about $ 11 billion , following a similar deal in
November for NRG Energy to acquire Texas Genco for $ 5.8
billion .
Owners of gas-fired power plants have been grappling with wide swings
in the price of natural gas in recent months after
a surge that followed the damage to offshore production platforms
in last year 's hurricanes .
Some investors , however , see opportunity in the price volatility .
LS Power ,
based in New York , raised about $ 1.2 billion last year
for a new fund focusing on acquisitions of electricity-related assets .
It bought a gas-fired power plant in Pennsylvania last August
from the Calpine Corp. for $ 225 million .
