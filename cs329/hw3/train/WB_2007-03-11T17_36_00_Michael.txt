Re : the connections ...wow...you could make a James Burke BBC show .
Laff ...
I 'd bet the Jamaican press stands got plenty of cane from Florida and/or Puerto Rico...maybe a bit from Loosiana .
More recently ( like oh , about three or four years ago ) , while engaging in random conversation at a local watering hole , I came across someone who claimed to be a supplier of cane for Bicardi Dark rum ( said he was farming near Houma , LA--about an hour or so from where I live now in Baton Rouge ) .
Anyway ...your description of the early 60 's drought down here makes me wish I 'd been a little more diligent about chronicling my grandfather and grandmother 's biographies before they passed away .
They probably would 've remembered that .
And I certainly would be better for taking the time ...
