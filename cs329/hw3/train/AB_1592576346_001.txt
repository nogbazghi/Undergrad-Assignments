For me , this book was really , really helpful .
Let me outline a few things that I found great about this book :
1 ) The non-boring way that the author incorporates statistics into every day life .
It gives a personal feel and does n't make you fall asleep !
2 ) Unbelievably , the glossary !
It 's nice to review .
3 ) Excel complements , so that you can actually be practical and learn statistics with a computer as well as by hand .
4 ) Great organization !
It 's very easy to follow .
5 ) Difficulty level of learning is low , but the difficulty level of the material is fairly high .
You learn lots of things with half the effort .
There are also , at the ends of each chapter , practice questions that really help out .
Once you 're through all of them , and there are n't THAT many , you memorize everything in the chapter without having to physically ( or mentally ) memorize them .
Great book !
I highly recommend it .
