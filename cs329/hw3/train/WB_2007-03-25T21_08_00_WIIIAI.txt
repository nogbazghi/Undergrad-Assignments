Some more diplo-gibberish from Condi in the Middle East , much of it about the âroad map.â 
She explained , âThe roadmap is really a kind of framework .â 
How will we use this roadmap , which is really a kind of framework ?
âWeâll use many different geometries , Iâm sure , as we go through this process , but the key is to continue down this road toward a two-state solution .â 
And in a press briefing , she added , âIâm quite flexible on what geometry we use .â 
Iâm not sure , but the different âgeometriesâ  may have something to do with the âpolitical horizonâ  she keeps talking about ( âif you âre going to talk about a political horizon , you have to know what issues people think are blocking the horizonâ ) , or possibly about her holding talks with Abbas and Olmert separately , that is , â I think they have to move more also in parallelâ .
Somehow , I donât think Condi remembers any more of her high school geometry than I do .
She accused Iran of âputting negative Iranian influence into an already difficult situationâ .
She says Bush is really quite involved in the Middle East process , really he is .
â[ A]nd you know Iâm with the President a lot , and it is almost always a subject when we are together .â 
Hoo baby .
â He is , after all , the author of the two-state solution more than you will probably ever know because when he was putting that speech together , it was the President who insisted on being clear that we were talking about the formation of a Palestinian state and even clearer what it would be called .â 
Readers may suggest in comments what Bush wanted to call the Palestinian state .
Not-Jew-istan ?
Asked in Egypt why the US did nât pressure Israel to give up its nukes , Condi replied , âweâve long said we hope that the day will come when there is no need for any state to contemplate the need for weapons of this kind in the Middle East .â 
So while I was looking for a nice picture of Condi to put on this post â  you know , this sort of thing ...
... I ran across this picture , which the AFP has captioned , âMembers of the Hamas security forces show off their combat skills during their graduation ceremony in Gaza City â .
Reading three of these transcripts in a row is doing funny things to my brain .
A reporter , following up about Saudi Arabiaâs role , said , âYeah , but you said hope and assume ...â  At which point I thought , âYes , and if you assume , you make an ass of u and me ; and if you hope , you make a ho pee .â 
I think it may be time to lie down and watch tonightâs Simpsons .
