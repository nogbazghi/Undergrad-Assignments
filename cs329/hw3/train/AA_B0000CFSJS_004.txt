It appears that I should have read the reviews before purchasing .
I too have several french white pieces that I purchsed years ago that I 'm very pleased with .
Seems the quality and construction has declined dramatically ( over the past few years ) .
From what I can tell about Amazon 's return policy , I 'd have to pay to return the item .
Maybe I 'll buy a dog and use it as a feeding dish ;-)
P.S. , ( I wo n't be buing any more corningWare ) !
