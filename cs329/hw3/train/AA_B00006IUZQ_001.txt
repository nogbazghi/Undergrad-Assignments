This is the newest of 3 hand mixers I own .
But I must say , it is the one that sits out on my countertop and now gets most of the use .
The 2 speed feature is great .
The low speed allows you to blend in bulky foods progressively then the high speed purees nicely and efficiently .
I hope you enjoy using yours as much as I enjoy using mine .
