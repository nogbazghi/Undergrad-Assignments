Ahmadinejad says Iranâs nuclear program is like a train without brakes or a reverse gear .
And the dining car is out of spoons .
Smintheus on the disappearance on the White House website of links to old interviews by top officials , including many of the embarrassing ones â  theyâll greet us as liberators , last throes , that sort of thing .
This reminded me that several years ago I linked to this article , about the siteâs attempt to keep search engine robots from cataloguing pages on certain subjects .
For some reason , the Bushies donât want us to be able to look up what they said in the past .
Holy War Joe Lieberman has an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal in which he warns against âparliamentary trench warfare .â 
He says , â I understand the frustration , anger and exhaustion so many Americans feel about Iraq , the desire to throw up .â 
Oh , sorry , âthe desire to throw up our hands and simply say , âEnough .ââ 
His solution is for everyone in Congress to shut up for six months .
âGen .
Petraeus says he will be able to see whether progress is occurring by the end of the summer , so let us declare a truce in the Washington political war over Iraq until then .â 
Finally , Joe Lieberman has found a form of âwarâ  that does nât make him as giddy as an inordinately giddy schoolgirl .
( Update : Glenn Greenwald has also read Lieberman , and lobs dozens of whizzbangs into his trench with great force and precision . )
A WaPo story on Operation Imposing Law said of the security stations that are supposed to be built in Baghdad : âLt .
Col . Christopher C. Garver , a U.S. military spokesman , said that although part of the stationsâ  function is to encourage Iraqis to visit , their locations would not be disclosed because of concern within the Iraqi government that such information would facilitate attacks .â 
The story does , however , quote one Baghdadhoovian who sees improvement : âThank God now the mass abductions and the militias seem to be slowing down , and we are only left with the suicide bombs and car bombs .â 
This one is getting intriguing : Eduardo DâAubuisson , son of evil 1980s death squad leader and evil politician Roberto DâAubuisson , was killed last week along with two other Salvadoran politicians and their driver in Guatemala ( driving to the Central American Parliament , which the three men were members of ) and the bodies set on fire .
The head of the Guatemalan national policeâs organized crime unit and three of his subordinates were arrested for it and within a couple of days mysteriously killed during a prison riot â  shot in their cells .
