It seems some of the reviewers are confused as to the purpose of this hose .
It is not a general purpose shop vac hose .
It is designed specifically to hook up to Bosch sanders without having to use the VAC002 adaptor to a 1 1/4 " hose .
I use it on the RS006 adaptor which replaces the canister on the 1295 and 1293 .
And it slides right on to the port on the 3x21 belt sander .
It has been made light so you can easily sand with it .
To make it big , heavy and reinforced would defeat it 's purpose .
It makes sanding much easier .
At 15 ft long you have enough hose and it has a 2 1/4 male end that attaches right to your shop vac.
For use specifically with Bosch sanders ( or maybe some other European stuff with the same size sander pickup ) I recomend it highly .
