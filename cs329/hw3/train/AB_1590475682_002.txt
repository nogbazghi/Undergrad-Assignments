Recently , I was asked to do some analysis on longitudinal patient data using fixed effects regression .
This book provided an excellent , step-by-step approach on how to tackle the problem .
The first two chapters cover an overview of fixed effects and random effects modeling in the context of ordinary least squares .
Then , Prof. Allison devotes a chapter to each of several topics : modeling binary outcomes , modeling counting outcomes , and modeling time to event ( I admit that I stopped at Chapter 5 ) .
I am particularly impressed by the way he shows different approaches to solving problems .
And , that he compares the performance of different routines .
It turns out that for many of my problems , proc genmod with GEE approximation is a good solution -- and one that finished in a few minutes rather than a few hours .
