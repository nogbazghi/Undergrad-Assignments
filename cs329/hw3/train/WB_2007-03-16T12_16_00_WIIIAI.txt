The Pentagon finally admits that âSome elements of the situation in Iraq are properly descriptive of a âcivil war , ââ  ( crappy writing : the term civil war describes Iraq , not the other way around ) , although they add âThe term âcivil warâ  does not adequately capture the complexity of the conflict in Iraq .â 
Iâm telling you : crapfest .
Tony Blair , on the other hand , wonât ( Word document ) : âitâs not a country at civil war .
The majority of people in this country [Iraq ] donât want this violence .
... What is happening is that small numbers on either side of extremists â  no , hang on a minute â  who donât represent the majority , are trying to provoke people into a civil war .
That is a completely different thing .â 
Are referenda usually held before the start of a civil war , and theyâre called off if there is nât an absolute majority in favor ?
Asked a couple of times if the Iraq war âwas worth it , â  he answers that it was and is the âright thingâ  to do , which is nât exactly the same as being worth it .
His shying away from the phrase is an interesting mirror-image of the outcry in the US when Obama and McCain said that soldiersâ  lives were âwasted .â 
I want McCain and every other supporter of the war to be asked if the deaths of American soldiers was worth it .
The Sky interviewer , Adam Boulton , asked if Blair thought Maliki is a democrat .
Blair : â I do believe he is a democrat , he was elected , right , and he was then chosen as the President...â  Boulton points out that Robert Mugabe was also elected and âjust being elected does nât make you a democrat does it ?â 
Blair : âEr , well I think it is quite a good indicationâ .
