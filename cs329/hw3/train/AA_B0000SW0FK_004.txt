one of the handiest little gadgets for the home .you
still need a prpoer vaccum but this is just great when you cant be bothered to lug out the vaccum! I have 3 of them around the house as I have dogs and the hairs are everywhere .the
dustbuster by itself seems to have more suction than thr vaccum part but its still good .
definitely recommend .
