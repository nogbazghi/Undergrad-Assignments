Yeah .
Yes .
A whole lot of more money , or more perks and --
Yeah .
And more fast cars and more advertising deals and --
Ugh !
-- you know , their -- their name on -- on the sneakers and the -- the soda and ...
Yeah .
And it was like , you know , when , um -- was it Seinfield and Friends and all that bunch , you know , they wanna come back for another season , but they want this amount of money or that amount of money and now , um -- who was it ?
-- uh , Keanu Reeves , Keanu Reeves ... ?
Yeah .
He 's put his own money into that ma - -- the Second Matrix .
Yeah .
I 'm -- I 'm waiting --
So --
-- for that to come out .
Yeah .
I -- I really want to see that .
I 'm -- I 'm a big fan of that kind of stuff .
And , um , so I 'm hoping on that too .
It --
Yeah .
I wanna -- wanna see those .
Um , Keanu Reeves is just a little weird , you know ?
Yeah .
He 's -- he 's not just in it for the money .
He 's -- he 's in it because he 's weird !
And he likes acting too I think .
Yeah .
But , um , you know , like -- like some of the TV shows they -- they just keep wanting more and more money every season --
Yeah , it 's like --
-- or certain actors want more money .
So , that they wind up killing off their character like -- I do n't know if you watch ER ?
Yeah .
But , you know , when -- when they had that whole long drawn out thing with Dr. Green dying of brain cancer , you know .
Mhm .
I think that 's 'cause the actor wanted more money or wanted to make movies or something .
Yeah .
Well , it 's like , uh , the guy that plays Tony Soprano .
Speaking of that , it 's what just come on TV --
Uh-huh .
-- and , uh , you know , him holding out and --
Yeah .
-- making the season late on that for more money .
And then there 's that kid that -- that plays the son that was actually , you know , in --even in the real world , trouble for , uh , drugs and stealing and fighting .
Yeah .
Yeah .
And I think he kinda pretty much walked away from that one too .
I 'm sure --
I think he had to do community service or some nonsense like that .
Yeah .
Probably protected , his community service .
But , like I said , I , um , when they asked this last night and I just -- for the life of me I ca n't figure out who 's getting ready to strike where .
No.
I never heard of that either .
