A fascinating study of two women--close friends--who attended art school together , but whose paths then diverged widely .
One woman , Alice Neel , became one of the greatest American painters of the 20th century .
The other artist , Rhoda Medary , chose a different life as a housewife whose artworks remained obscure .
How and why these two painters traveled their respective paths makes for illuminating reading , especially for today 's woman artist .
The issues these women grappled with are far from being resolved in contemporary society : how a woman balances a career with marriage and/or motherhood ; how an artist responds to pressure from family and culture to conform ; how to follow your dream but still pay your bills .
Highly recommended .
