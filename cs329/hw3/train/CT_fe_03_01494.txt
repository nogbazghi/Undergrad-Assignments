You know it --
I ca n't say that I do anything different , uh , as --
Yeah , me neither , 'cause I -- I feel like , you know , why -- I 'm gonna be start looking at people and , uh , and saying , " Well , you 're from there , so I guess --"
Yeah .
"-- you may be .. . " I 'm like , you know , you do n't know .
Yeah .
You do n't know who will be the person that come after you .
Right .
And I think that it 's -- when it 's your time to go , it 's your time to go .
Yeah .
It does n't matter .
You know .
So just live your life as it is , uh , as full as you can --
Yeah .
-- right now .
And instead of just watching TV and then kinda , " Okay , today I 'm gonna do this because --"
Mhm .
"-- it seems like , you know" .
It 's like when they have these like , high alerts over the United States , you know ?
Yeah .
Over here in Washington they 're like , wow , they have --
Yeah .
-- you know , you ca n't go to the station , you know , because they 're gonna do -- they may do this .
I 'm like , " Come on , I cannot just , you know --"
Yeah .
"-- not [inaudible ] " --
And I -- I think that -- that is about the only thing that , you know , unfortunately I hear you say that , I think that 's about the only thing that I have changed , is raising a eyebrow at , uh , those that look like they might be from that , uh , um , country , uh , like this -- I hope that 's nobody buzzing in my [inaudible] .
Uh-huh .
Um , uh , but that 's about the only thing that it has done , is raise that eyebrow .
And I do n't like that , so , uh , because I do n't want to prejudge people , because I have friends --
Mhm .
-- that are from diff - -- that are from different countries and so forth and -- and I 've worked with , uh , international students a long time , and , you know , I just -- I just -- just do n't think that you should look at everybody just because they 're not white , " Oh , well , that must be --"
Yeah .
"-- uh , uh , they 're -- they 're a suspect " you know ?
Yeah .
Or just br- -- just because they look like they 're from there , oh , they 're a suspect .
Yeah .
You know ?
And --
Yes .
Y - you do n't know --
But --
-- you know ?
It 's too -- it 's too broad of a -- it 's too broad of a thing to do , so I think basically what we 've done is just that , you know , we 're just not gonna go thinking that way , you know ?
Yeah .
We 're just gonna continue to live our lives as we 've been .
