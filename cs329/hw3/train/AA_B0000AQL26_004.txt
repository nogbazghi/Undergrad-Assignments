Despite its impressive accuracy , and a wow factor up there with Maverick 's other 'gee-whiz ' instruments , I have found programming refrigerator and freezer setpoints just impossible without the original user 's guide .
I discovered how non-intuitive this "must-have gadget " seems after replacing the batteries ( a good 6 months after I actually followed the original guide ) .
What now ? Simply leave it alone with its new AAAs and see what happens . . .
maybe Maverick put a brain in there .
