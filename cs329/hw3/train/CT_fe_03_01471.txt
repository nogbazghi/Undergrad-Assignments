And I 've always considered myself to be very open and unbiased --
Yeah .
-- and unprejudiced in my opinion --
Mhm .
-- and it really bothered me that the community that I live in was so quick to judge , thinking that these people were associated with bin Laden and with the terrorist attack , when it 's like , whoa , whoa , whoa , these -- you know , the people who actually own , it , um , were born and raised in the United States --
Right .
-- it was his father that came over from Syria due to the Catholic and religious persecution .
Mhm .
But noone -- but , but not a lot of people know that .
And --
No. And , and certainly it 's , you know , it 's happened everywhere .
Yes .
It 's , it 's a very -- it 's very hard , because the profile of the -- of not only the September eleven terrorists , but the other attacks , the Mogadishu attacks were all -- you know , they were all Middle Eastern males between seventeen and forty .
Yes .
And , and so , how do you not profile ?
And -- and , like , so I guess --
Yes .
-- I can still see doing that at airports , or --
Yes .
-- you know , places that apt to be , ah , -- at risk , and at the same time you certainly do n't wanna harass , like you say --
The innocent .
-- innocent people --
Right .
-- who have absolutely no connection and they 're as horrified as anyone else with , with what happened .
Well , we also know that in the state of Michigan , that one of the largest Arabic influences , and the largest Arabic immigrant population is in Hamtramck , Michigan .
Which is about --
Mhm .
-- two and a half hours from me .
Mhm .
And we do know that there were cells over there , and there is a little town , it 's called Cold Water , Michigan --
Mhm .
-- which is to the west of me , and Cold Water has , um , right now we do know , and everyone knows it , that we have federal agents in Cold Water because --
Yes .
-- of the amount of , um , Arabic men that are there .
Yes .
And I , I 'm sure that 's true anywhere , that has a large Muslim community , and , and --
Yes , and it 's very scary .
Yeah , yeah , it is very scary .
But I , I think to some extent they , they should have spoken out more strongly after this happened .
I think so too .
I , I felt that we should have been over there the next day , honestly and truly .
And I think --
My husband --
-- the Muslim community should have spoken out more after this happened --
Yes .
Also -- also .
My -- my husband is an ex marine --
