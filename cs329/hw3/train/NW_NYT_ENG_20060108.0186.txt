-- The Mystery Castle .
This one 's a bit weird , but worth
a gander .
In the 1930 and early '40s , an eccentric
named Boyce Luther Gulley built this quirky manse for his
daughter , who as of last spring still was conducting the
tours herself .
It 's in South Mountain Park , several miles south
of downtown .
For more information : (602 ) 268-1581 .
-- Taliesin West .
This was architect Wright 's winter home , and tours
give insights on his honor-the-surroundings designs and the property 's desert
surroundings .
On Frank Lloyd Wright Boulevard in Scottsdale , this spot
is closest to Giants games and is time-consuming enough that
it might be best for a non-baseball day ( or to
see before a night game ) .
Its prices ( $ 18 to $ 22.50
general ) are as upscale as the suburb .

-- White Tank Mountain Regional Park .
A pleasant nature trail here
makes the list primarily because it represents one of the
few attractions in the western Phoenix suburbs , near the four
teams in Peoria and Surprise .
