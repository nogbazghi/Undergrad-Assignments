I 'm a huge Cannell fan and this was just terrible .
I admit I am not a fan of black comedy . . like the movie "war of the roses " .
People offing each other so they can fulfill a dream does not make for likable characters .
If I ca n't relate to the protagonist and understand his rationale or his sociopathy then what is the point ?
His wife is a bitch , his daughter is a biker-chick , his business is failing , boo hoo .
So he goes and kills a perfectly decent man so he can have a new wife ? ? ?
I made it to page 52 and skipped to the end to see if the book had any redeeming qualities ...none .
I choose my books very carefully because my free time is very precious to me .
So once I 've invested the money and time I usually finish a book sometimes just to further my understanding of the author 's style .
Mr. Cannell , what happened here ?
You owe me one !
